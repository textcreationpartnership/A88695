            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, The outward form of Bapti≈øme was the ≈øame; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for as he baptized with the ≈øame matter, why ≈øhould we imagine he ob≈øerved not the ≈øame form that Chri≈øt commanded to his Apo≈øtles.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Neither Chri≈øt nor his Apo≈øtles rebaptized any that were baptized with the Mini≈øtery of <hi>John. Apollos</hi> that was baptized with <hi>Johns</hi> bapti≈øme, we read not that he was baptized again.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If a difference, then Chri≈øt was baptized with another bapti≈øme than we are, or he him≈øelf commanded. Our bapti≈øme was ≈øanctified in the per≈øon of Chri≈øt; the members have the ≈øame bapti≈øme with the head.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Chri≈øt him≈øelf te≈øtifieth, that the bapti≈øme admini≈øtred by <hi>John</hi> portained to the fulfilling of all righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15.

                        <p>That it is a grievous ≈øin in ≈øuch as being not lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, offer to take upon them the Mini≈øterial Function.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is the u≈øurpation of anothers office <hi>alieni muneris u≈øurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi> One of the highe≈øt offices in the world, which ≈øin God hath vi≈øited with grievous judgments, as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>zza</hi> who was ≈ømit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with ≈øudden, and unexpected death, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. only becau≈øe he exceeded the bounds of his calling in putting up his hand to ≈øtay the Ark from falling, which onely belonged to the Levites; although his intent and purpo≈øe was never ≈øo good, yet it di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øed God, he had no word, nor warrant for it. <hi>Azariah</hi> is made a Leper to the day of his death for attempting one act of the Prie≈øts office, and but once, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> had a ≈øpecious pretence for their u≈øurpation; yet fire con≈øumes <hi>Corah,</hi> and his company, and the earth ≈øwallows <hi>Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> They had perverted that order that God had e≈øtabli≈øhed to continue in his Church, and the Lord works a ≈øtrange work, altering the cour≈øe of nature. Now although God doe not thus execute judgment from Heaven when his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are violated, yet this ≈øin is not hereby le≈ø≈øened, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment mitigated, nor the hand of God ≈øhortned. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt are of much more worth, and value than tho≈øe of the Old Te≈øtament, and are therefore guilty of much ≈øorer puni≈øhment; Sacred Functions ordered by God, mu≈øt not be prophaned by voluntary u≈øurpations.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the ≈øin mu≈øt needs be great, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becau≈øe it fights again≈øt this in≈øtitution which was given for our direction. This ≈øin is not only again≈øt man, but again≈øt the Author and In≈øtituter of

It cannot be without di≈øhonour to God, without the check and controlement of Je≈øus Chri≈øt who is the Captain of his own ho≈øt, the head of his own body, Lord of his own hou≈øe, and the great King of his own Church: if therefore private per≈øons admini≈øter the Sacraments they ≈øin again≈øt God, and go beyond the bounds of their calling.<note place="margin">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168349:32"/>unwa≈øhen hands; for what is it to enter into the Mini≈øtery, but to enter into the pre≈øence of the great King? If God rebuked <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> for ≈øtepping too ha≈øtily to the bu≈øh where his pre≈øence was, how will God check the con≈øciences of ≈øuch as carele≈øly ru≈øh into the Mini≈øtery and to Gods holy Table, where God is pre≈øent in a farre more excellent manner than he was in the bu≈øh?

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper is a ≈øpeciall part of the Mini≈øteriall Office, that it ought not to be neglected or laid a≈øide. Severall Rea≈øons ≈øhewing that the long Omi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of it is unwarrantable.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe cloth of gold with which the Church is apparelled is the righteou≈øne≈øs of Chri≈øt imputed. The hand that putteth on this goodly Garment is faith; and the Sacraments confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our faith in Chri≈øt, are the buttons, as it were, cla≈øping the cloake clo≈øe to the ≈øoul. We have already clearely proved that it is the office of the Mini≈øter of the Go≈øpell, and to him it properly belongeth to preach the word and Admini≈øter the Sacraments. Having ≈øpoken of Bapti≈øme I ≈øhall now pre≈øume to offer ≈øomething concerning the Lords Supper. God in all ages hath given his Church outward repre≈øentations and vi≈øible ≈øignes of inward, ≈øpirituall, and heavenly things: ≈øuch were the tree of Life, and the tree of Knowledge of good, and evil; The ratifying his Covenant to the Jewes by Circumci≈øion, and the Pa≈ø≈øeover; and to us by Bapti≈øm, and the Lords Supper; which as vi≈øible Sermons preach unto us the love of God, and give a≈ø≈øurance of his promi≈øes: his Word is the Evidence, his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ts the Seals; and what is promi≈øed by the one, is ≈øealed by the other. God did not think his outward word ≈øufficient, but al≈øo added this Sacrament of his la≈øt Supper, for our further a≈ø≈øurance, and confirmation, a te≈øtimony of his faithfulne≈ø≈øe, a pledge of his promi≈øes, a token of unmea≈øurable love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy again≈øt all carnall doubting and di≈øtru≈øt; having not only his hand writing, but ≈øeale, from whence the faithful ≈øoul draws an argument of much comfort and ≈øpiritual con≈øolation; here are not onely promi≈øes, but the writing of God, the oath of God, and the ≈øeale of God for confirmation. The Sacrament of the Lords Supper doth more clearly and fully (con≈øidering the manner of working) repre≈øent and paint out before us the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168349:37"/>love of God in Chri≈øt, than the word doth; for we doe not only hear of Chri≈øt, but as it were, ≈øee, handle, touch, and ta≈øte him. Now the Lord hath ordained Officers, Keepers of his great Seal whom he hath deputed, and ≈øet apart to this very end, to ≈øeale his promi≈øes and Covenant-graces to every believing ≈øubject. And therefore if any (≈øo deputed) ≈øhall through pride, envy, or any ≈øini≈øter re≈øpects &amp; groundle≈øs excu≈øes no waies warrantable refu≈øe to put to this Seal for that u≈øe and purpo≈øe God intended it, is guilty of no ≈ømall crime, and de≈øerveth ju≈øtly to bear Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice no longer. At my coming to this place I did upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ≈øome godly Chri≈øtians (con≈øidering the long omi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of this Sacrament) admini≈øter the Lords Supper, yet not without many praevious Sermons made for the in≈øtruction and preparation of my Congregation, at which ≈øome more preci≈øe than wi≈øe, took offence; and whereas it was intended as a bond for further communion, it was made u≈øe of to a finall ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and my practi≈øe extremely condemned, and my per≈øon expo≈øed to much calumny, being the beginning of a ≈øad per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. I mu≈øt crave ≈øome time to vindicate my practi≈øe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolving by Gods a≈ø≈øi≈øtance that <hi>truth</hi> ≈øhall never ≈øuffer by my negligence or cowardize: as I long ≈øince ≈øatisfied my ≈øelf, ≈øo I hope I ≈øhall ≈øatisfie others in this particular. What I did in giving the Sacrament to all indifferently, mu≈øt be con≈øidered in a time when there was no government or di≈øcipline in the Church. I ≈øhall humbly propo≈øe</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whether the practi≈øe of ≈øuch Mini≈øters as for a long time omit the giving of the Lords Supper where there are ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects capable of receiving it; <hi>viz:</hi> (both knowing and godly Chri≈øtians) be warrantable or not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I ≈øhall lay before you ≈øuch Rea≈øons as are alledged for the omi≈ø≈øion of it. Concerning the fir≈øt, I re≈øolve upon the holding the Que≈øtion negatively, That the practi≈øe of ≈øuch as for a long time omit the giving of the Lords Supper, where there are ≈øubjects capable is not warrantable, and that upon the≈øe en≈øuing grounds:</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the long omi≈ø≈øion puts a barre to a Chri≈øtians thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈ø≈øe, for one end of the Lords Supper is to ≈øhew forth with thank≈øgiving the death, cro≈ø≈øe, and ≈øufferings of Chri≈øt: when
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:168349:38"/>we read or hear of Chri≈øts pa≈ø≈øion we are greatly affected, but much more when he is ≈øet before our eyes, and vi≈øibly crucified in our ≈øight, this extremely moves devout affections, and leaves behinde deep impre≈ø≈øions: No action more than this ≈øets out before us the great love and goodne≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt our Saviour, in which, every believing ≈øoule mu≈øt needs acknowledge the depth of Gods mercy and love, who through Chri≈øt was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us mi≈øerable ≈øinners, enters into a League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be our God, and ≈øeales his grace and un≈øpeakable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by this Sacrament; he loves us living and dying, and leaves a perpetuall commemoration of his love to mankinde, being in this exhibited not onely to the eare, but eye and ca≈øte, which affords exqui≈øite fruition and delight.

It is a ≈øigne to ≈øignifie and repre≈øent a ≈øeal, to ratifie and confirm; the promi≈øes we read are confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the believing ≈øoul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, in his Son our Saviour, for him hath God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øealed, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. The riches of the New Te≈øtament are confirmed to us by the blood of Chri≈øt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by Gods privy Seal: his Spirit is called <hi>the Spirit of promi≈øe,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 1.13.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, God confirmeth his promi≈øes by this Sacrament, which is his broad Seale to confirm our faith, and ratifie our a≈ø≈øurance in Chri≈øt: It doth give and conferre faith, but more ≈øurely and ≈øtrongly confirms faith; which confirmation is not by any inherent power in it, but by the holy Spirit working a ≈øtrong per≈øwa≈øion and a≈ø≈øurance in us, ≈øealing the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant, which doe chiefly con≈øi≈øt of three parts:</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>the forgivene≈ø≈øe of ≈øins,</hi> Jer. 33.8. I≈øa. 43.25.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>the adoption of ≈øons,</hi> Jer. 31.31, 32.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>the promi≈øe of Eternall ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe.</hi> And what greater ble≈ø≈øings than pardon to poor ≈øinners, acceptation of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølaves to be ≈øons, and to have the promi≈øe of Everla≈øting life? This is the Covenant written by God, to which he hath put to his Seale for our further a≈ø≈øurance: One Tree of Life ≈øerved <hi>Adam,</hi> One Rainbow gave a≈ø≈øurance to <hi>Noah,</hi> but to us behold Two unchangeable Sacraments, two witne≈ø≈øes whereby we have full a≈ø≈øurance. Now I conceive that the deferring of this Seale from time to time, which doth confirm our Charter, is a great weakning of our faith, hindrance of our a≈ø≈øurance, and ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant of grace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the long Omi≈ø≈øion is a barre to the communion that ≈øhould be betwixt Chri≈øt and Chri≈øtians one with another, hence it takes its denomination of <hi>communion,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. As faith receives him, ≈øo by this we are joyned near to him and have ≈øpiritual fellow≈øhip with him; by this (he means) that the faithfull which come with due preparation are joyned and united to Chri≈øt by Faith in≈øtrumentally, by the Bread ≈øacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, and by the Holy Gho≈øt ≈øpiritually made one ≈øpirit, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.17. or one ≈øpiritual body: as the members receive life from the head, and the tree moy≈øture from the root, ≈øo the faithful from Chri≈øt.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, this ≈øeals that communion that Chri≈øtians have one with another: For we that are many are one bread and one body, becau≈øe we are all partakers of one head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. It puts us in minde of our unity and concord being one body, and to avoid di≈øcord and di≈ø≈øention, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 20. <hi>When ye come together, &amp;c.</hi> This was one end why it was ordained of Chri≈øt, to be a bond of love, and chain us together, that we break not from God and our Brethren.<note place="margin">Of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Art. 28.</note> The Church of <hi>England</hi> ≈øaith, that the Supper of the Lord is not onely a ≈øigne of love that Chri≈øtians ought to have among≈øt them≈øelves one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. This are we taught by the ≈øame bread compact of many corns, the ≈øame wine pre≈øt out of many grapes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. Oh how many great and grievous are our di≈øtractions!

What a ≈øhame is it that the Sheep of the ≈øame Shepheard, the Children of the ≈øame Father, the Servants of the ≈øame Ma≈øter, the Heirs of the ≈øame Kingdome, the Gue≈øts of the ≈øame Banquet, the Partakers of the ≈øame Hope, the Members of the ≈øame Body, the Profe≈ø≈øours of the ≈øame Faith, ≈øhould contend, and ≈øtrive one again≈øt another, fighting, quarrelling, hating, envying, and backbiting one of another. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> condemning the abu≈øes of the Corinthians, exhorts them to tarry one for another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.33. that they would go hand in hand, and lay a≈øide all difference and di≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And our Saviour enjoyns Brotherly reconciliation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.24. <hi>When thou bringe≈øt thy gift, &amp;c.</hi> I appeal to any judicious Chri≈øtian, whether this fact doth not conduce to the renewing and maintaining of love, and was by our Saviour in≈øtituted to that very end, and whether the ≈øeldome u≈øe of it be not a great cau≈øe of that generall hatred, rancour, ≈øpight and envy of one again≈øt another.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the long Omi≈ø≈øion of it is a barre to the frequent meditation of the great work of Redemption.<note place="margin">Art. 28.</note> The Church of <hi>England</hi> calls this a Sacrament of our Redemption by Chri≈øts death. It was Chri≈øts la≈øt word to his Di≈øciples, the words of a dying friend, which ever leaves behinde deep impre≈ø≈øions, <hi>[Doe this in remembrance of me,]</hi> it was re≈øerved till the approaching
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168349:39"/>of his death, that we might the better remember him when he was dead: God gives the Rainbow, a token of mercy to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterity; the fir≈øt born mu≈øt be ≈øanctified, that ≈øo the day of the Jewes deliverance out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> might be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred: There mu≈øt be a Golden pot of Manna re≈øerved for the remembrance of that great mercy in feeding the Jewes with Angels food. When the Lord parted the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> he commanded <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> to ≈øet up 12 Stones in memoriall of his mighty and miraculous works, and that when the Children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> ≈øhould aske in time to come what was meant by tho≈øe ≈øtones, they ≈øhould an≈øwer, that the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. Even ≈øo the Lord hath left unto his Church the Sacrament of his Supper as a vi≈øible repre≈øentation of a crucified Chri≈øt, and hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to continue this holy remembrance of his death and pa≈ø≈øion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25, 26. to be kept in memory, and remain to po≈øterity that they might know the occa≈øion of it. I de≈øire that it may be con≈øidered, whether the long omi≈øsion of the Lords Supper doth not hinder Chri≈øtians from a frequent meditation of the great work of Redemption.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the long Omi≈øsion is a barre to the ≈øerious and ≈øad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our ≈øins: it is true, we are every day to call to minde our wormwood and our gall, to ca≈øt up our accompts, <hi>Quid feci, quid non feci?</hi> Yet we had need of all helps to this end, and the Sacrament being a lively repre≈øentation of a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Chri≈øt, doth bring to our mindes the remembrance of our bitter ≈øins, that brought to Chri≈øt ≈øuch bitterne≈ø≈øe of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Magna amaritudo peccati quae tantam amaritudinem pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perit,</hi> Great was the bitterne≈ø≈øe of ≈øin which brought forth ≈øo much bitterne≈ø≈øe of torment.

None are more guilty than we who≈øe ≈øinnes are tho≈øe bloody in≈øtruments that ≈ølew the Lord of glory.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the long Omi≈øsion is a barre to tho≈øe helps that doe a≈ø≈øure us of the promi≈øes, and ≈øtrengthen our faith.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, by this the Lord repre≈øents his promi≈øes, as it were, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

It is ob≈øerved, that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth more ≈øeal the promi≈øes than the Word doth, not for the ≈øub≈øtance and matter it ≈øelf, but for the manner of working, making us after a ≈øort to handle Chri≈øt with our hands, and ≈øee him with our eyes. Though the Word and Sacraments agree as in≈øtruments, by which the holy Gho≈øt u≈øeth to make us one with Chri≈øt, and partakers of ≈øalvation, the working and forcible power of both depending on God alone, and flowing from him as from a fountain; and yet they differ, in that the Word is offered to all, none excluded and debarred from the hearing of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. yet not all to be admitted to this. Again, the Word begins and begets faith, but this is of another nature. We mu≈øt bring Faith with us: the Word affects the eare, but this offers Chri≈øt to the eyes, and we ≈øee him crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this Sacrament ≈øtrengthens faith, it is an effectual means to that very purpo≈øe, and it is found by experience that Chri≈øtians in their ≈øpiritual langui≈øhings gather ≈øtrength from this heavenly Manna, being a ≈øpeciall ≈øupport, and prop to faith. The Lords Supper is defined by Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi> to be the Sacrament of the nouri≈øhing and growth of the faithfull in Chri≈øt. Why ≈øhould that be denied which Chri≈øt him≈øelf hath appointed as an help and means of this growth and nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The Lords Supper is to be con≈øidered under a fourfold notion: 1. As it is a ≈øpiritual medicine to cure the remainders of our corruptions. 2. As it is a ≈øpiritual food to ≈øtrengthen our weak graces. 3. As it is a ≈øpiritual cordial to comfort our di≈øtre≈ø≈øed con≈øciences. 4. As it is a ≈øtrong ob≈øignation and forcible engagement to all acts of thankfulne≈ø≈øe, and obedience in Je≈øus Chri≈øt. I leave it to any experienced Chri≈øtian to judge, whether their faith hath not been greatly ≈øtrengthned in the frequent receiving of this ble≈ø≈øed Sacrament, and in the long forbearance have found much weakne≈ø≈øe of faith.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the long Omi≈ø≈øion of the Lords Supper is not warrantable,<note place="margin">Jemes.</note> becau≈øe it is a ≈øpecial part of Gods po≈øitive and in≈øtituted wor≈øhip.

                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a Mini≈øter doth but what his calling obligeth him to; and if the event be not good, the parties contract guilt, and pull down vengeance on them≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>The power of a Mini≈øter to admini≈øter the Lords Supper is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168349:47"/>called by Divines <hi>Pote≈øtas ordinis,</hi> or <hi>pote≈øtas muneris ≈øpecialis,</hi> it is a Church-power more ≈øpecial, and is di≈øtingui≈øhed from the power of juri≈ødiction, which is more general and common: a Mini≈øter ought to exerci≈øe and employ for the edification of the Church all the power and authority that he may lawfully exerci≈øe.

                     <p>Fir≈øt, the want of Di≈øcipline is to be lamented. <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Secondly, all ≈øcandalous per≈øons convicted to be ≈øuch, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Church ought to ca≈øt out; but we are not to ca≈øt our ≈øelves out of the Church, and debarre our ≈øelves from the Ordinances of Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if Presbytery never be ≈øetled, as is neither impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> nor impo≈øsible; ≈øhall this nece≈ø≈øary Ordinance be never di≈øpen≈øed? God forbid.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Sacrament of the Lords Supper hath been truly admini≈øtred without Presbytery, otherwi≈øe we ≈øhall ≈øhew our ≈øelves the mo≈øt uncharitable people that ever breathed, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the preceding Church for many generations, and throw dirt in their faces that ≈øuffered Martyrdome for maintaining the truth, and purity of this Ordinance: I ≈øhall onely in≈øtance the admini≈øtration of the Lords Supper by our Saviour, which was mo≈øt exact and perfect in the point of E≈ø≈øentials, and a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for the Church, for after-times; it wanted nothing E≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially belonging to the true di≈øpen≈øation of it: in≈øomuch that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øticks clo≈øe unto that pattern, and telleth the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, <hi>What I have received, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Now at that time (I think none will affirm) that the Church was presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and that there were Lay Elders among≈øt the Apo≈øtles:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168349:48"/>or that it appeareth out of <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. &amp; 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. That tho≈øe that received the Lords Supper were all examined by an Elder≈øhip,<note place="margin">Ieanes.</note> otherwi≈øe no admittance; the Lords Supper hath no e≈ø≈øential dependance on an Elder≈øhip, as that it cannot be without it. It is no ≈øuch nece≈ø≈øary antecedent as that the Lords Supper is to be omitted or forborn for the want of it; for if Presbytery never be e≈øtabli≈øhed, ≈øhall the Lords Supper never be admini≈øtred? God forbid. The exerci≈øe of Di≈øcipline as I ≈øaid before, is not nece≈ø≈øary for the e≈ø≈øence of a vi≈øible Church, but onely nece≈ø≈øary to the welbeing of a Church. But now, all doe ≈øay, That the Sacraments are, though not ab≈øolutely, yet in ≈øome degrees nece≈ø≈øary to the e≈ø≈øence &amp; beeing of a Church. So then, if you compare together the≈øe two duties, Exclu≈øion of ≈øcandalous and ignorant per≈øons from the Lords Supper, and the Celebration of the Lords Supper; the Obligation unto the Admini≈øtration of the Lords Supper, is of the two, the greater and more weighty. For the Lords Supper is more the wor≈øhip of God, le≈ø≈øe ≈øeparable from, and more nece≈ø≈øary to the Church than exclu≈øion of ≈øcandalous and gro≈øly ignorant per≈øons from the Lords Supper. Therefore it is altogether improbable that this latter, <hi>viz: exclu≈øion,</hi> &amp;c. ≈øhould be an Antecedent ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely nece≈ø≈øary unto the former, <hi>viz: the celebration of the Lords Supper.</hi> That the Pa≈ø≈øeover and Circumci≈øion were omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> in the wilderne≈ø≈øe is mo≈øt true, yet that makes nothing to this purpo≈øe. For after the fir≈øt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Pa≈ø≈øeover all future celebrations were by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe and plain command to be in the Land of <hi>Canaan, Exod.</hi> 13.4, 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. from the 1<hi rend="sup">≈øt</hi> to the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, therefore this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concludeth nothing.</p>

                     <p>OF the fir≈øt, <hi>Perfecting of the Saints,</hi> where let us con≈øider what is meant by <hi>Saints,</hi> and what by <hi>Perfection. Saint</hi> the Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>terra,</hi> denoting that <hi>holy men</hi> ≈øhould be <hi>unearthly, holine≈ø≈øe</hi> is in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition to <hi>earthline≈øs.</hi> Oh how few are the number of Saints in the≈øe dayes that grovel altogether on the Earth! GOD is in their Mouth, the World in their Hearts, like the fooli≈øh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median, they cry <hi>O Coelum!</hi> and point the finger downward. Oh how is this pretious name abu≈øed, and by many a≈ø≈øumed, as the Devil <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle, to deceive, driving on their own ends and intere≈øts, and ri≈øing to honour and preferment by the ≈øtaires of pretended Saint≈øhip. As Religion is the be≈øt thing, ≈øo the Corruption of it the wor≈øt. <hi>Corruptio optimi e≈øt pe≈ø≈øima,</hi> and the greate≈øt villany and michief hath marched under the flagge of Religion, Either intended by the ≈øeduced, or pretended by Hypocrites, their own hypocri≈øie deludes them, ≈øo that they grow amorous of their ≈øeeming virtues: if they can appear good, there is little care taken how to be good, as if all Religion con≈øi≈øted in appearance, whereas it ≈øhould be from God: the coal of our zeal ≈øhould be fetcht from heaven, for God and the furtherance of his glory, not our own ends and intere≈øts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. according to God both for the quality of the matter, and quantity of the intention of affection, according to that of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. <hi>It is good alwaies,</hi> there is the quality of the matter; <hi>to be zealous in a good thing,</hi> there is the quantity of the intention of the affection. But to come to the word <hi>Saints,</hi> it admits of a double ≈øignification, either by External profe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Internal regeneration. The fir≈øt is known to us, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God, for the foundation of God ≈øtandeth ≈øure, and the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168349:49"/>Lord onely knows who are his; the one are his in the judgment of charity, the other in the judgment of infallibility. People outwardly profe≈ø≈øing Religion and manife≈øting to the world lives conformable, may be called Saints. So was the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. The Church of <hi>Philippi, Phil.</hi> 1.1. and yet there were many Hypocrites among≈øt them; in this ≈øen≈øe men may be Saints and yet damned; profe≈ø≈øe Religion, ≈øeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, and yet want the power of godline≈ø≈øe and ≈øincerity. Many doe wofully delude them≈øelves with the name when they are nothing in truth and reality; but alas! when the≈øe are to die, and death ≈øtares them in the faces, how ≈øad will be their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; it is not an empty name will ≈øerve the turn, there mu≈øt be more to the attainment of heaven.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> what is meant by <hi>Perfection,</hi> or <hi>Perfecting:</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is a ≈øtate not to be obtained on Earth, but re≈øerved for Heaven. <hi>Talis ≈øedes expectat talem Se≈ø≈øorem,</hi> Such a hou≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ≈øuch an Inhabitant: as long as we carry fle≈øh about us ≈øin we will, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Non plenam induimus perfectionem donec totam exu mus infectionem.</hi> All the ≈øtains of our infection mu≈øt be wa≈øhed away before there can be perfection.

                        </note> 3.12. <hi>Not that I had already attained, &amp;c.</hi> It is true, we are ≈øaid to be perfect here, <hi>perfectione partium, ≈øed non perfectione graduum;</hi> partially, but not gradually: though every part be in ≈øome mea≈øure ≈øanctified; yet we mu≈øt grow to a perfect man: we are <hi>Mundi &amp; mundani,</hi> Clean in part, and in part to be made clean; all our perfection con≈øi≈øts in the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our imperfection.

This is a pa≈ø≈øive quality: <hi>Non qui perficiunt, ≈øed qui perficiuntur;</hi> Not ≈øuch as have made them≈øelves perfect, but are made perfect. Our purity is not <hi>in facto,</hi> but <hi>in fieri;</hi> inchoate, not fini≈øhed. The wicked are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect√® imperfecti,</hi> perfectly imperfect. The godly are <hi>imperfect√® perfecti,</hi> imperfectly perfect.

                        <hi>Forgive us our trespa≈ø≈øes.

                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that the Saints are not above Go≈øpel-Ordinances.

This is not the end why God hath placed the≈øe Officers in the Church, but to be faithful and powerfull in the di≈øcharge of their duty. The onely thing that ≈øhould be de≈øired by a Pa≈øtor, is, the weal and benefit of his flock; for if the mark whereat we look be but to make our commodity by the Go≈øpel of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, wherein doe we differ from thieves and robbers? This is that whereof the Lord complains ≈øo grievou≈øly by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>The Prie≈øts teach for hire, the Prophets prophe≈øie for money: yet will they leane upon the Lord, and ≈øay, Is not the Lord among us?</hi> And again, the≈øe ≈øhepheards cannot under≈øtand: they all look to their own way, every one for his advantage, and for his own purpo≈øe. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ble≈ø≈øing <hi>Levi</hi> before his death, ≈øaith fir≈øt, <hi>They ≈øhall teach Jacob thy judgments, and I≈ørael thy Law; they ≈øhall put incen≈øe before thy faece:</hi> and then addeth, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øe, O Lord, his ≈øub≈øtance, accept the work of his hands.</hi> As if he ≈øhould have ≈øaid, So long as <hi>Levi</hi> and his Sons doe not ≈øeek their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, but thy glory; thou art righteous, and can≈øt not forget to provide in large manner, both for them and theirs.</p>
                     <p>A third end is, <hi>the edifying of the body of Chri≈øt:</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this concerns ≈øuch as are to be called and converted. The gifts of the Spirit are given to every man to edifie withall, 1 Cor. 12.7. <hi>Po≈øiti e≈øtis dispen≈øatores, ≈øed in aedificationem, non in de≈øtructionem: aliter non fidelis dispen≈øatio, ≈øed crudelis di≈ø≈øipatio,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Bernard:</hi> Ye are placed for edification, and not the de≈øtruction of any; It is true, the word proveth the ≈øavour of death to death, but that is accidentally, and not the proper work of it: while≈øt we ≈øeek to win your ≈øoules to God, give us the hearing: otherwi≈øe it is not po≈ø≈øible our doctrine ≈øhould tend to edification.

                     <p>Fourthly, the blo≈ø≈øoms of profe≈ø≈øion will not ≈øerve, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> without the fruits of a holy practi≈øe, Gal. 5.25. <hi>If we live in the ≈øpirit, let us walk in the ≈øpirit,</hi> Jam. 2.20. <hi>Wilt thou know, O vain man! that faith without works is dead?</hi> Jam. 1.26. <hi>If any man among you ≈øeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans Religion is but vain.</hi> Whiles you ≈øtyle your ≈øelves Religious, you give a mighty wound unto Religion by your cen≈øoriou≈øne≈ø≈øe, malice, per≈øecution, and uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, no Characters of Religious per≈øons.

                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that is the mo≈øt dangerous vice that bears the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and wears the cloak of virtue. As there is an unfeigned zeal of a fal≈øe Religion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.14. ≈øo a counterfeit zeal of a true Religion. Beware ye be not of the number of tho≈øe <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ≈øpeaks of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. that make Religion a faction: for there are many in this City go under that name, that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and filthy. It is ≈øeen by ≈øad experience, that many poor ≈øouls are wofully deluded by a carnal opinion ari≈øing from their own conceit, and Sathans deceipt.</p>
                     <p>I conclude then, it is unhand≈øome to blaze your own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs: you may ju≈øtly ≈øu≈øpect your own ≈øincerity. Let your pious charitable deeds commend you. Hear the Apo≈øtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Let no man deceive him≈øelf: If any man among you ≈øeemeth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe in this world, let him become a fool that he may be wi≈øe.</hi> But I much admire you excu≈øe not Mr. <hi>Butlers</hi> marrying of two, whom I much honour; either you want a hand≈øome excu≈øe, or el≈øe think it not worthy the taking notice of. Did you not hear of it? was it not ob≈øerved? what a gap doth this open to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and confu≈øion? no regard to the neare≈øt Relations. May not <hi>Tom</hi> the Tinker, <hi>Will</hi> the Cobler, <hi>Harry</hi> the Carter plead the ≈øame liberty? Was it ever allowed by any Church or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that private per≈øons, not in office, might tie the knot of marriage? It is needle≈ø≈øe to relate how much I honour the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the Gentlewoman for their mode≈øty, piety, and fair Chri≈øtian carriage. I am heartily ≈øorry they ≈øhould be ≈øo delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the lowly paire who intended nothing but cha≈øt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:168349:61"/>≈øo abu≈øed. I wonder you doe not ≈øtand a≈øhamed and confounded within your ≈øelf, when you con≈øider what you have done, and how farre you have exceeded the bounds of Religion, Rea≈øon, and common civility. I have known the time (you may ble≈ø≈øe the liberty of this (for ≈øuch as you reap benefit of it) that ≈øuch an action would not have pa≈ø≈øed unpuni≈øhed. I ≈øhall conclude this with an expre≈ø≈øion of Mr. <hi>Butlers</hi> to Mr. <hi>Crafton, That at that time he came to</hi> Lichfield <hi>there was no Ordination in</hi> London. I blu≈øh and admire at your frivolous excu≈øes and groundle≈ø≈øe a≈ø≈øertions: was there no Ordination in <hi>London</hi> fron <hi>June</hi> 1651, at which time you were motioned to <hi>Lichfield</hi> till <hi>May</hi> following 1652. Had you been as carefull to have been ordained, as you were covetous of means, you might not have wanted Ordination. The Committee for the Univer≈øities, and the Tru≈øtees and Committee for plundred Mini≈øters had your name given them as a Mini≈øter, and a Certificate to that purpo≈øe; for, they never ≈øetled any in any place but ≈øuch of whom they received te≈øtimony that they were Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel. I wonder by who≈øe means and ≈øollicitations tho≈øe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimonies and Certificates were procured, who was guilty of the≈øe deliberate untruths; did the Mini≈øter ≈øub≈øcribe ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? the ≈øin of misinformation was yours; if knowingly, then both equally guilty: how can you free your ≈øelf from aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and jugling in this kinde? Upon the≈øe Certificates you were a≈ø≈øigned to a publick Charge, and had the allowance of 150 li. <hi>per annum,</hi> preached, baptized, and married. Are the≈øe light and ≈øleight things? have you not cau≈ø to be humbled, and lay a≈øide your vain and frivolous excu≈øes; to cozen your brethren, to delude a Committee?

                        </note> yet this is not all: it is a true ob≈øervation, <hi>Vix bono peraguntur exitu, quae malo ≈øunt inchoata principio.</hi> Things ill begun, ar not commonly well ended. You have abundantly manife≈øted this, not onely by your Schi≈øme, which hath cau≈øed a wide breach in a peaceable City, though I u≈øed all po≈ø≈øible means to prevent it; being truly ≈øen≈øible of tho≈øe ≈øad effects and con≈øequences that en≈øue upon the divi≈øion of Mini≈øters, that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:168349:61"/>nothing would content you but a di≈øtinct Charge contrary to the order of ≈øettlement which enjoyned a joynt charge of the City and Pari≈øhes thereunto belonging, had we continued as one, would have been a ≈øtrong motive to have per≈øwaded the City to follow our example; but you mu≈øt needs row to the North, and leave me alone in the South. At your fir≈øt coming to <hi>Stowe</hi> you owned the people as your flock; you had not been there above two moneths, but your friends ≈øent to a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Councel of State (doubtle≈ø≈øe not unknown to you) to bring you to that place and people you had before denied; you have now your longed expectation, though to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpeakable trouble. And let the City judge whether I ever in the lea≈øt troubled or di≈øquieted you in your place. I ≈øhall pa≈ø≈øe by your ≈øcornfull language to Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> in which you di≈øcovered a great deal of pride and malice. I am con≈øtrained to adde one thing, and were there nothing el≈øe, that be≈øpeaks you mo≈øt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, that you had privately a hand in my bitter per≈øecution, for the accompli≈øhing of your ≈ølf-ends. You have not been good neither <hi>in gre≈ø≈øu,</hi> or <hi>progre≈ø≈øu,</hi> and therefore a miracle if good <hi>n egre≈ø≈øu.</hi> All is well, ≈øo long as you fare well and rule the ro≈øt; you took a politick cour≈øe how to be a≈ø≈øured to feed your ≈øelf, before you fed your flock; and to have maintenance, before you were a Mini≈øter: what a prepo≈øterous thing is this, neither lawfull by Mans or GODS Laws, that ≈øuch ≈øhould have Church-means that were not Church-men, or ≈øet apart to the Mini≈øtery? I reade, that when the good Prophet wept upon <hi>Hazael,</hi> he asked, <hi>Why weepeth my Lord?</hi> He an≈øwered, <hi>Becau≈øe I know the evil that thou wilt doe to the Children of I≈ørael. Their ≈øtrong holds wilt thou ≈øet on fire, ≈ølay their young men with the ≈øword, da≈øh their Children again≈øt the ≈øtones, and rip up their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Childe.</hi> He replied, <hi>What, is thy ≈øervant a dog, that I ≈øhould doe this great thing?</hi> What I ob≈øerve is this, that he thought it impo≈ø≈øible, that the Devil ≈øhould ever work him to ≈øo horrid a mi≈øchief; yet by degrees, he was wrought to this ≈øelf-incredited mi≈øchief, as impo≈øsible as at the fir≈øt he judged it, at la≈øt he performed it. It is ju≈øtly to be feared, now you are arrived to the pitch of your de≈øires, you will involve the poor City in much confu≈øion, and di≈øorder; for, Schi≈ømaticks are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:168349:62"/>men of unquiet and turbulent ≈øpirits, and your actions be≈øpeak you a proud, ≈øeditious, and ≈øelf-ended Man: and now for≈øooth you are got to be a Commi≈øsioner for ejecting of ≈øcandalous Mini≈øters: it is a brave world, when vice rebuks ≈øin; hopes of a glorious Reformation. I appeal to any who have read the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of the Fathers, and others, upon that text of CHRIST, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15. whether your practice ≈øuites not with the character of tho≈øe Wolves our Saviour ≈øpeaks of. You that have made no con≈øcience at the great ≈øin of <hi>intru≈øion,</hi> will ≈øcarcely boggle at any. I have read a ≈øtory (with it I conclude) out of Sir <hi>Richard Barkley,</hi> of a Reverend and Religious Archbp. of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who (being a long time depraved, and in fine deprived of his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and office by two corrupt Cardinals, his Judges, and a fal≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Advocate his familiar friend) out of the bitterne≈ø≈øe of his ≈øpirit, made his appeal from them unto the Lord of Heaven. God knoweth (unto whom all things are naked) that I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtly condemned; yet I will not appeal here from your ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; for that I know ye ≈øhall ≈øoonr be believeed in your ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than I am in ≈øpeaking the truth; and therefore I receive this heavy cen≈øure for the rebellions of my youth, and other ≈øins: neverthele≈ø≈øe, I appeal from your judgment, to the Judge Eternall, and onely wi≈øe, which is CHRIST JESUS, before whom I ≈øummon you. The Cardinals fell into a laughing, and ≈øaid, That <hi>if he would goe before, they would follow.</hi> It hapned that within a year and half, the poor Bi≈øhop died; the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals did not long ≈øurvive; the one was ≈ølain, the other eat off his own hands and died mad. And la≈øtly, the <hi>Judas</hi> of all (I mean his fal≈øe friend placed in his room) was mortally hated of all men, for his ≈øedition and cruelty, and afterwards came to an untimely end. Such as take delight in per≈øecution, e≈øpecially of Mini≈øters, hale judgments one their own heads; which I pray God divert. I be≈øeech you con≈øider, ≈øin is habituated by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtome, and hardned by impenitency; if you cannot ≈øtay your ≈øelf from going in ≈øin, ≈øtay your ≈øelf from going on; if you will break out, timely break off by repentance. Let God be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in an humble acknowledgment. It is the voice of a friend, <hi>Aut praevenire errori, aut revocare errantem;</hi> Either to prevent a man before he erreth, or to recall him erring. When mens
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:168349:62"/>wits, and the Devils to help, have found out the faire≈øt pretexts for ≈øin, Gods ju≈øtice ≈øtrikes off all, and leaves ≈øin naked and puni≈øhable. Many pretences have been found out for many ≈øins, be≈øides di≈øtinctions, mitigations, qualifications, extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, colours, que≈øtions, nece≈øsities, inconveniences, tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ignorances, &amp;c. But when man hath done, God begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; one argument of Gods now, is ≈øtronger than all ours. Thou ≈øhalt not doe this. Con≈øider the examples of <hi>

                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>zziah;</hi> for <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>zzah,</hi> God had charged that none but the con≈øecrated Prie≈øts ≈øhould touch the Arke. <hi>

                        <hi>[untill we all come to the unity of the faith, and of &amp;c.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Unity, in the Text, hath a double relation:
<list>
                           <item>1. To Faith.</item>
                           <item>2. To Knowledge.</item>
                        </list> And the object of both is Chri≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Faith is taken pa≈ø≈øively,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Adams,</hi> The Saints meeting.</note> or actively; either for that whereby a man believeth, or for that which a man believeth; either for the in≈øtrument that apprehendeth, or for the object that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. Now if we take it for the form, there is an Unity of Faith, <hi>Ratione objecti, non ratione ≈øubjecti,</hi> One in re≈øpect of the object on which it re≈øts; not one, in re≈øpect of the ≈øubject in which it remaineth; every man hath his proper faith, and every faith hath Chri≈øt for its object: he that ≈øeeth, mu≈øt ≈øee with his own eyes; he that feeleth, mu≈øt feel with his own hands; he that entreth into the man≈øion of glory, mu≈øt have oyle ready in his own lamp; the ju≈øt ≈øhall live by his own faith, and we ≈øhall all meet in the unity of one holy Catholick faith. Now if we take it in the other ≈øen≈øe for Chri≈øt, in whom we have believed, we ≈øhall meet undoubtedly in the unity of tho≈øe joyes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which we have long expected; and all Believers ≈øince the Creation till the worlds Di≈ø≈øolution ≈øhall meet in the unity of faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there ≈øhall be Unity of Knowledge at the la≈øt day, though the manner of knowing cea≈øeth, yet the matter remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; all our knowledge in this life is through the ≈øpectacles of faith, in the gla≈ø≈øe of the Scriptures; we ≈øee in part, we know imperfectly, we behold Chri≈øt through the latte≈ø≈øe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.9. darkly through a gla≈ø≈øe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. but in heaven we ≈øhall
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:168349:73"/>know him face to face; we ≈øhall live by ≈øight, not by faith: faith and hope ≈øhall vani≈øh, there ≈øhall be onely fruition in heaven; and in this we ≈øhall all meet, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2.</p>
                     <p>To a perfect man; full perfection is re≈øerved for heaven, when our reunited bodies and ≈øoules ≈øhall po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe perfect glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and reign with our Saviour for ever. We are ≈øaid here to be one body who≈øe head is Chri≈øt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. but there, one perfect man; and in truth the expre≈ø≈øion is very patheticall, for the Saints in glory cannot be called a body, for a body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives augmentation, encrea≈øe, and growth; ≈øo this my≈øticall body encrea≈øeth with the encrea≈øe of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. Now in heaven there is no augmentation, encrea≈øe, and growth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the Saints compared to a perfect man.</p>
                     <p>To the mea≈øure of the Stature; not that all in heaven ≈øhall be of that age wherein Chri≈øt died, onely it denotes that there ≈øhall be nothing wanting to make our glory perfect; here we ≈øhoot out ≈øome few boughs, bring forth ≈øome little fruit, we grow as fa≈øt as we can, adding to faith, virtue; to virtue, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but there we ≈øhall have a full mea≈øure of ≈øanctity, of comfort, of bli≈ø≈øe, of glory, of the fulne≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Chri≈øts fulne≈ø≈øe is to be con≈øidered per≈øonally, or my≈øtically; per≈øonally in him≈øelf, and ≈øo he is not onely perfect, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. in him dwelleth not onely a ≈øufficient fulne≈øs, but all the fulne≈øs; not of any created nature, but of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; not phanta≈øtically, but bodily.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is to be con≈øidered my≈øtically, or in relation to his Church, who ≈øhall be gathered together to the head, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the fulne≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt. The words thus explained, there ari≈øeth from hence this truth:</p>
                     <p>That the office and function of the Mini≈øtery is not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,<note place="margin">Ob≈ø.</note> but perpetuall, that is, mu≈øt remain till the Saints be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in glory, it mu≈øt continue till we all meet, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>God was the fir≈øt Teacher and Doctour of the world, as he was in him≈øelfe, ≈øo in his teaching wonderfull; in proce≈ø≈øe of time this Divine wi≈ødome thought it nece≈ø≈øary to u≈øe outward in≈øtruments, and to teach the ≈øons of men, by Men; yet through various di≈øpen≈øations, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.1. God can give ≈øpirituall life without the ordinary means; he can maintain a naturall life
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168349:74"/>without bread, he can give wi≈ødome without a Teacher, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him is impo≈øsible, but what is to us naturall, ≈øin, and defects: though God can doe all things by his ab≈øolute power, yet it is his will to ordain his Word as the ordinary means of ≈øalvation, to give men knowledge by in≈øtruction, and ≈øave by teaching. Thus <hi>Cornelius</hi> was taught by <hi>Peter, Lydia</hi> by <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> by <hi>Ananias,</hi> the Eunuch by <hi>Philip,</hi> Every Soul that is wi≈øe in the Doctrine of Salvation by Apo≈øtles, Prophets, Evangelifts, Pa≈øtors, and Feachers appointed for the gathering together of the Saints for the work, &amp;c. When the Lord intended a ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing to his people, he made them this promi≈øe, <hi>I will give you Pa≈øtors according to my heaert, that ≈øhall feed you with knowledge and under≈øtanding.</hi> Now the Lord hath not at any time cea≈øed, and left off, but from the infancy of the world to this pre≈øent hour hath continued the Mini≈øtery to his Church; Chri≈øt gives his Apo≈øtles a Commi≈øsion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all Nations;</hi> and concludes with a promi≈øe, ver≈øe 20. <hi>Loe I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, &amp;c.</hi> God will ≈øend ≈øhepherds till every lo≈øt ≈øheep be brought to his fold; the Mini≈øters voice ≈øhall ≈øound, till the Archangels voice be heard.<note place="margin">Art. 23.

The proper office of the Law is to terrifie, to condemn; but the power of the Go≈øpel is to convert, to ≈øave. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> glory is done away, the type is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed; but Chri≈øts glory remains, and abides for ever: after the fir≈øt Te≈øtament, there did follow a ≈øecond; but after the ≈øecond, there ≈øhall ≈øucceed none: the Go≈øpel in the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. is called, <hi>the everla≈øting Gospel.</hi> The Mini≈øtery of the Go≈øpel (≈øaith <hi>Zanchy</hi>) begun with Chri≈øt, and ≈øhall end with the world; but the power of it is everla≈øting, <hi>A condito orbe u≈øque in omnem aeternitatem duratura,</hi> for it is the power of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:168349:74"/>God unto ≈øalvation unto every one that believeth: not onely is it called ≈øo in regard of the power of it; but that everla≈øting life is the ≈øubject of it: it holds forth eternall life, and is the common ordinary means of bringing us thither; as the blood of Chri≈øt mu≈øt be for the ≈øaving of ≈øinners to the end of the world, ≈øo his Go≈øpel mu≈øt be preached that the people may be taught how this blood mu≈øt be applied.</p>
                     <p>As long as there is a Church upon earth which will be to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon &amp;c.</hi> God can a≈ø≈øoon forget him≈øelfe, as his promi≈øe; cea≈øe to be God, as cea≈øe to be faithfull: As long, I ≈øay, as there is a Church on Earth, ≈øo long mu≈øt there be Teachers in and for the edifying of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 28. and ≈øo here <hi>he hath given ≈øome Apo≈øtles, ≈øome Prophets &amp;c.</hi> Experience telleth us, there are Wolves as full of craft as cruelty, who de≈øiring to devour their flock, endeavour the removall of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, but <hi>Pan curat oves ovi√∫mque magi≈øtros.</hi> Our great Shepherd pre≈øerveth his ≈øheep and ≈øhepherds.

                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from hence we may take notice of Gods great love to his Church, from time to time, rai≈øing up Prophets, Evangeli≈øts, Pa≈øtors, and Teachers, whereby Sathans dominion is weakned, Chri≈øts kingdome advanced, being the means of daily intercour≈øe betwixt God and man; ≈øpeaking unto them as a man to his friend, and be≈øeeching them by us (through Chri≈øt) to be reconciled to him; it is a very ≈øad and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing when the Lord depriveth a Nation of this ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing: when the Lord meant happine≈ø≈øe to his people, he made them this promi≈øe, <hi>I will give you Pa≈øtors according to my heart, which ≈øha feed you with knowledge and understanding;</hi> but to deprive you of this, is a token, that ruine and de≈øtruction is at hand, unthankfull are that people that will not acknowledge the wonderfull ble≈ø≈øing of God in the Mini≈øtery: the want of this, doubtle≈ø≈øe, is one of the greate≈øt judgments that can befall a people So the Lord threatneth <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11. to be debarred of the glad tydings of ≈øalvation, and not hear the ≈øound of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel, but wander in darkne≈ø≈øe, and ignorance, mu≈øt needs be a heart-breaking and heart-tormenting ≈øorrow: The Lord out of his love giveth Mini≈øters to his Church, and they are for their works ≈øake to be beloved, and prayed for; for if the Lord ≈øhould totally eclip≈øe the≈øe Lights, it would be the darke≈øt, and di≈ømall'≈øt day that ever your eyes beheld.

Many kill us whom we would cure (though not in our naturall) yet in our civill life, our reputation; though we feel not actuall murtherings, we are ≈øen≈øible of cruell murmurings. <hi>I≈øhmaels</hi> tongue made him a per≈øecutor, a≈øwell as <hi>E≈øau</hi>'s hand. I tremble to con≈øider to what malice and envy this holy calling is expo≈øed, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>We are made a gazing-≈øtock to the world, to men, and Angels,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.9. <hi>Athana≈øius</hi> was nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Satana≈øius, Cyprian</hi> called <hi>Caprian, Paul</hi> accounted mad, CHRIST reputed a Conjurer, ca≈øting out Devils through <hi>Reelzebub</hi> the chief of Devils.

But more of this in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> if God give his Church this priviledge of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery, they may expect a priviledge of God, that is, protection; Hath his wi≈ødome ≈øent them? and ≈øhall not his power protect them? <hi>I ≈øend you forth in the mid≈øt of wolves;</hi> 'tis true: but the ≈øame Chri≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>I am with you alwaies, &amp;c.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is ≈øent to a rebellious Nation, impudent Children, ≈øtiffe-necked, <hi>Ezek</hi> 2.3, 4. but ob≈øerve what followeth, <hi>ver≈øes</hi> 5, 6. <hi>and they, whether they will hear, &amp;c.</hi> We mu≈øt fight with Bea≈øts, as did S. <hi>Poul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 32. with ravening Wolves, with Devils un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Saints.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:168349:85"/>the patience and time of the Chri≈øtian Reader, and for that I conceive the An≈øwer to the≈øe, to be a full Solution of the re≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Only I am ≈øorry, that the great Light of the Church, Mr. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is entituled by the Objectors to the patronage of their Cau≈øe. How≈øoever, we are not to ≈øub≈øcribe, with a blinde obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to the dictates of any great Ma≈øter: E≈øpecially, when he goes ≈øingle again≈øt the current of all ≈øound and Reformed Churches. Yet thus much I can ≈øay for him, That his opinion is ≈øo qualified, that it affordeth little or no advantage to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors, nor openeth a door to that <hi>Chaos</hi> of confu≈øion which they would introduce: For albeit he might hold, That all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians be equally Prie≈øts, having the ≈øame power in the Word and Sacraments; Yet he denieth, that any may u≈øe or exerci≈øe this power, without the con≈øent of the Community, or calling of a Superiour. <hi>In lib. de capt. Babyl: cap. de Ordine.</hi> Which is enough to keep out ≈øacrilegious Intruders.</p>
                     <p>This opinion, as it is not ≈øound, ≈øo neither is it ab≈øurd or much inconvenient: For, as a Mini≈øter that hath that power by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ordination, cannot lo≈øe that power by Degradation, or otherwi≈øe, becau≈øe it is a gracious gift never to be reiterated, and called by the Schoolmen (how properly I know not) <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter indelebilis:</hi> So by degradation &amp;c. he may be re≈øtrained from the u≈øe and exerci≈øe of this power; and if he u≈øe it before re≈øtitution, he ≈øinnes. Which is a tenet ≈øo generally admitted of all hands, that I hold it lo≈ø≈øe of time to labour in the proof of it.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.</note> This place is taken out of the Prophets, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 52.7. <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.15. though not the ≈øame <hi>≈øerie &amp; ordine Scripturae,</hi> in Scripture words; yet the ≈øame <hi>quoad ≈øen≈øum Scripturae,</hi> in Scripture ≈øen≈øe; for ≈øcarcely is there any place quoted out of the Old Te≈øtament, but it varieth in ≈øome words in the New; yet it may be ≈øaid to be the ≈øame, as it is written,<note place="margin">Nah. 1.15.</note> 
                        <hi>How beautifull!</hi> The Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> addeth the word <hi>Behold: Behold how beautifull!</hi> This is ever the Herauld of ≈øome excellent thing, it is as the ≈øounding of a Trumpet before ≈øome great Proclamation; or like the ‚òû in the Margine of a Book, pointing to ≈øome remarkable thing of great con≈øequence, and imports ≈øome ≈øpecial note worthy our deeper and more ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ob≈øervation; it is as the ringing of the great Bell before the Sermon of ≈øome famous Preacher, it requires, and calls for our be≈øt and ≈øerious attention, <hi>Behold.</hi> The Philo≈øophers are called, the Secretaries of Nature; The Prophets, the Oracles of the Law; And the Mini≈øters, the Stewards of the Go≈øpel: Or as one calleth them, Gods High Commi≈ø≈øioners, who have power to be in≈øtrumentall by the preaching of the Go≈øpel, to redeem Soules from the power of Hell and the Devils clawes, <hi>Job</hi> 33 24. Though in the judgment of the world, no condition is thought to be more ba≈øe or vile than this calling; yet Chri≈øt thought ≈øo highly and honourably of it, that refu≈øing to be King, he cho≈øe the office of a Mini≈øter: he did not account it a ≈ølavery to ≈øerve the Lord. Now the calling of the Mini≈øtery ≈øeemeth to be honourable by tho≈øe ≈øeverall Names and Titles given to tho≈øe that bear the office.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they are termed Angels: and <hi>John the Bapti≈øt</hi> is called <hi>Angelus Dominl,</hi> The Me≈ø≈øenger or Angel of the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Origen</hi> mi≈øtook in thinking him an Angel indeed; he was
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:168349:86"/>not ≈øo <hi>Natur√¢,</hi> but <hi>Officio;</hi> Not in Nature, but in Office: this is given to the Prie≈øt of the Old Te≈øtament, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>He is the Me≈ø≈øenger of the Lord of Ho≈øts.</hi> And to the Mini≈øters of the New, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.1.8.12. Chap. 3.1, 7, 14. ver≈øes. The Mini≈øters of the ≈øeven Churches are called, <hi>the Angels of tho≈øe Churches.</hi> Now as Angels, ≈øo Mini≈øters are not to carry their own me≈ø≈øage, but the me≈ø≈øage of their Lord and Ma≈øter; and to be re≈øpected, and had in e≈øteem for their works ≈øake.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are termed the Servants of Chri≈øt: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he that ≈øerves him≈øelf, ≈øerveth a Fool; he that ≈øerves the Devil, ≈øerves his Enemy; he that ≈øerves the World, ≈øerves his Servant; but he that ≈øerves CHRIST, ≈øerves his Maker, and Ma≈øter: A ≈øtyle not ba≈øe, but exceeding honourable; <hi>David,</hi> a King, yet boa≈øts notwith≈øtanding of this title, <hi>Behold I am thy ≈øervant, I am thy ≈øervant, P≈øal.</hi> 116.16. All the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apo≈øtles, have gloried in this ≈øervice. If it be honourable to ≈øerve a King, a≈ø≈øuredly greater to ≈øerve the King of kings. <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a Door-keeper in the hou≈øe of God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedne≈ø≈øe, P≈øal.</hi> 84. All Chri≈øtians are Gods ≈øervants, ≈øworn to fight under Chri≈øts banner, and to continue his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Souldiers and Servants unto their lives end. But Mini≈øters, they are his Servants in ordinary neer unto him, and after a ≈øpecial manner employed in the ≈øervice of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Other men may ≈øerve God, and yet walk in their callings: but Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers have no other calling, but to ≈øerve God, to bring Soules into his Sheepfold, and to enlarge his kingdome. The ≈øpiritual Labourer is worthy of his hire; but if he labour for hire only, he may make him≈øelf merry with his reward on Earth, Heaven hath none for him. That good is well done that is done of con≈øcience. If then they are Gods ≈øervants, they are not their own Ma≈øters. They have a Ma≈øter, even God, who≈øe they are, and for whom, and from whom they come; and therefore, for their Ma≈øter's ≈øake, to be beloved, and honoured: <hi>He that despi≈øeth you,</hi> (≈øaith Chri≈øt) <hi>despi≈øeth me.</hi> God will e≈øteem the wrongs of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as done to him≈øelfe; their di≈øhonour is his own. They are Servants, not for ba≈øe u≈øes, as <hi>Moab, P≈øal.</hi> 60.8. to wa≈øh pots; but preferred to offices of tru≈øt, and offices of honour, to bear the Lords ve≈ø≈øels, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 52.</p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:168349:87"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> they are Gods mouth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt be as my mouth:</hi> it is God in them that ≈øpeak. They are Chri≈øt's mouth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. Seeing that ye ≈øeek experience of Chri≈øt that ≈øpeaketh in me, &amp;c. This may teach you to hear our voice; not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the Word of God, 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 2.13. Chri≈øt ≈øaid of the wicked Phari≈øees, <hi>Que dicunt facite,</hi> Doe as they ≈øay, but not as they doe. <hi>Augu≈øt:</hi> again≈øt <hi>Pet: lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. ≈øaith, <hi>Dicunt enim quae Dei ≈øunt, faciunt quae ≈øua ≈øunt,</hi> They doe their own workes, but ≈øpeak the Lords Word; and therefore doe as they ≈øay: So long as the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers deliver the whol≈øome words of our Lord Je≈øus, you mu≈øt entertain them as the Angels of God, even as Chri≈øt Je≈øus. He that de≈øpi≈øeth the Me≈ø≈øengers of Gods Word, loves not the me≈ø≈øage, nor him that ≈øent him. He that cometh into the publick place to entrap the Mini≈øter, and carp at his word; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to affront and abu≈øe the King of kings and Lord of lords, who≈øe ≈øervants they are, and who≈øe me≈ø≈øage they bear.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> they are Gods Amba≈ø≈øadours, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. They are not common Amba≈ø≈øadors, but <hi>Legati √† latere,</hi> Stewards of his hidden ≈øecrets: If an honour to a Subject from an Earthly King, much more to a poor Worm, [Man,] to be Amba≈ø≈øadour to the King of kings: for, what is an Apo≈øtle≈øhip, but the Lords Amba≈ø≈øage? A title of ≈øuch honour as Chri≈øt him≈øelf di≈ødained not to be called an Apo≈øtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. They bring the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of reconciliation betwixt God and Man. The Lord hath honoured us to be in≈øtrumental to tie this knot, yet for the hand of the mo≈øt High God to perfect: He vouch≈øafeth this honour to us as his In≈øtruments, that we in his name, and power, ≈øhall tye a double knot on Earth, not onely temporal, but Eternal of the believing Soule to her husband CHRIST. Not that we have power of our ≈øelves; for, were we all <hi>Boanerge≈øes,</hi> the ≈øons of Thunder, we are not able without him to turn your hearts to righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe; it is Chri≈øt that mu≈øt clear the eye, undeaf the eare, unlock the heart, and ≈øhake the inmo≈øt power of the ≈øoul, as the thunder ≈øhakes the wilderne≈ø≈øe: It is by our Mini≈øtery, not our authority that your Souls are converted. Let the power be a≈øcribed to God, not to us. It is no ≈ømall honour to be Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øadours to the King of kings, Mini≈øters of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:168349:87"/>3.6. and therefore glorious. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> who≈øe countenance the I≈øraelites might not behold for his glory; yet are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of Chri≈øt more glorious than he, <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 8. <hi>How ≈øhall not the mini≈øtration of the Spirit be rather glorious &amp;c?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, they are Gods Stewards, his high Stewards, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                        <hi>Let a man account of us as the Mini≈øters of Chri≈øt, and Stewards of the my≈øteries of God:</hi> they are not onely Amba≈ø≈øadours, but <hi>Legati √† latere,</hi> Stewards of his hidden ≈øecrets; not onely <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpen≈øatores Mini≈øteriorum,</hi> as in the Vulgar Latine, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Original, <hi>My≈øteriorum,</hi> Di≈øpen≈øers of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are my≈øteries; and preaching of his ≈øaith, which is a deep ≈øecret, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16 Now, ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, Let a man e≈øteem of ≈øuch, not a≈øcribe too much, or give too little; not magnifie them as Chri≈øt, for they are not Ma≈øters, but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters; and yet not vilifie them, for they are not ordinary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but Stewards, and that of Gods own ≈øecrets.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, they are the Ma≈øters of A≈ø≈øemblies, <hi>Eccle≈ø.</hi> 12.11. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and therefore to be reverenced; Spiritual Fathers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 15. and therefore to be honoured; Phy≈øicians not of the body, but of the ≈øoul; to ≈øpeak properly, Chri≈øt is our onely Phy≈øician who hath the ≈øoveraign balm of <hi>Gilead;</hi> but allegorically, they are called Phy≈øicians, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.22. Not that they cure of them≈øelves, but that they apply Chri≈øts ≈øaving Phy≈øick to the ≈øickly ≈øouls of his people; and therefore to be e≈øteemed. They are termed <hi>Saviours,</hi> as in the la≈øt ver≈øe of the Prophe≈øie of <hi>Obadiah.</hi> And Saviours ≈øhall come up to mount <hi>Zion Take heed,</hi> ≈øaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle, <hi>unto thy≈øelf, and unto thy doctrine: continue in them: for in doing this, thou ≈øhalt both ≈øave thy ≈øelf, and them that hear thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. and therefore in no wi≈øe to be de≈øpi≈øed; becau≈øe he that receiveth the≈øe, receiveth Chri≈øt; and he that de≈øpi≈øeth the≈øe, de≈øpi≈øeth Chri≈øt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.40.

Philo≈øophers tell us, that the Sun doth partly enlighten the ≈øtarres of Heaven; but Divinity ≈øaith, the Sun of Righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe doth wholly enlighten the Starres of the Church; God hath placed them high, that they may the more commodiou≈øly ≈øhine to us: So he hath put Mini≈øters in eminent places that their light may be more per≈øpicuous. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles are lighted, and not thru≈øt into blinde and dark corners.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> they are Gods Labourers, not in mean things; but in the Word, farre more excellent than either gold, or pretious ≈øtones, <hi>Job</hi> 28. than the Gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> than much fine gold, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 19. This is that Jewel which the Merchant in the Go≈øpel bought with the ≈øale of his whole ≈øub≈øtance; the Word, the immortal Word of God. Now that that is of price, mu≈øt needs be of e≈øtimation; that, that is profitable, is honourable: and truly were there no other Rea≈øon but this, that they hold forth the Word of God, the ordinary means of ≈øalvation; the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and in≈øtrument of ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe, and everla≈øting life, it were enough to prove the dignity of their calling. I might proceed to other Names, and Titles, there being no le≈ø≈øe than two and twenty in Scripture that denote their worth and dignity, but this may ≈øuffice. Truly, Brethren, we live in an Age, whereof it may be ≈øaid, <hi>Innumerae pe≈øtes Erebi glomerantur in unum.</hi> The mi≈øchiefs of Hell are ≈øwarmed to one round; and the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Dumah, Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> may all be found in <hi>England:</hi> and this ≈øin of the contempt of the Mini≈øtery is not the lea≈øt, it was one ground of a day of Publick Fa≈øting not long ≈øince; and it may be one ground, of our daily, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual lamenting, to ≈øee this high and honourable calling ≈øo ba≈øe and vile in peoples opinion. The <hi>Galatians</hi> received S. <hi>Paul</hi> as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:168349:88"/>an Angel of God, yea as Chri≈øt Je≈øus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14. but many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre their Swine before them. The Word of God is the Plow of the Lord, the People the Husbandry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9 The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters are his Oxen to work at his plow, to break up the fallow ground, and to tread out the corn. Now how be their mouthes muzzled, and they that feed others have nothing to feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, tyed to the rack and manger? But alas! this is not all, how are they rayled on, reviled, traduced, their name and fame bla≈øted, as if they were the ≈øcum, and off ≈øcouring of the earth? It is mo≈øt unnatural for a man to de≈øpi≈øe his brother the ≈øonne of his own father, it is a brand ≈øet upon the tongue that mu≈øt burn with unquenchable flames, that it ≈øpake again≈øt his Brother, and ≈ølandred his own Mothers Son, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 50.20. but greater is their ≈øin, and le≈ø≈øe cannot their puni≈øhment be, that not onely condemn their brethren, but vilifie their Fathers, tho≈øe whom God hath cho≈øen as in≈øtruments of their ≈øpiritual good and ≈øalvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. When the Lord would brand the I≈øraelites with a mark of the greate≈øt reproach, he ≈øaith, <hi>Thy people are as they that rebuke the Prie≈øt,</hi> Ho≈ø. 4 4. <hi>[as]</hi> is here taken ab≈øolutely, they are ≈øuch as indeed Rebuke the Prie≈øt; they were not onely impatient of reproof, but which was more, they contended with their Teachers. They le≈ø≈øoned them that would not be le≈ø≈øoned by them, and rebuked tho≈øe by whom they were rebuked; they were grown ≈øo in≈øolent, and impudent in their ≈øins that they dur≈øt defend them again≈øt their Reprovers, and ≈øpeak proudly, and pre≈øumptuou≈øly again≈øt the Me≈ø≈øengers of God. This is a common di≈øea≈øe, and plague of this Nation, that in every Town, and City, the people are as they that rebuke the Prie≈øts. That impudent and in≈øolent claim is made ordinary in the≈øe daies; With our tongues we will prevail, for our lips are our own, no calling or degree is free from ≈øuch. I ≈øhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude at this time; That the di≈øgraces of Gods Prophets, be they in word, or in deed, are alwaies rewarded with Gods judgments. The boyes of <hi>Bethel</hi> that ≈øcoffed at <hi>Eli≈øha</hi> were rent in pieces with Bears, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. The mockers of his Me≈ø≈øengers doe hale down on their own heads the wrath, even the remedile≈ø≈øe wrath of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 36.16. The di≈øgraces done to them, the Lord accounts as done to him≈øelf, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.8. <hi>What are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:168349:89"/>we? your murmurings are not again≈øt us, but again≈øt the Lord. David</hi> accounted the abu≈øe offered to his Me≈ø≈øengers as a di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to him≈øelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.5. And our Saviour ≈øaith, <hi>He that desp ≈øeth you despi≈øeth me, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 10.16. They ought to be had in honour, and e≈øtimation, becau≈øe of their me≈ø≈øage. They bring the glad tydings of ≈øalvation; and, <hi>how beautifull are their feet &amp;c?</hi> I ≈øpeak this to the ≈øhame of ≈øuch that have no more reckoning of their Mini≈øters, than the Aegyptians of their Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.34. Every Sheep-keeper was an abomination to the Aegyptians: The≈øe, like the Devil, will ≈ømite <hi>Job</hi>'s ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when he cannot ≈ømite <hi>Job</hi> him≈øelf: The Jewes will ≈øcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingly ≈øay, <hi>Is not this the Carpenter's Son?</hi> Many will make u≈øe of any thing that may di≈øgrace them, but not con≈øider them in the worthine≈ø≈øe of their calling, in the weight of their me≈ø≈øage, or in any thing that may adde to their commendation. I leave ≈øuch as the mothes of a mans name and fame, the Cankerworms of the Church, the di≈øturbers of peace, and enemies of God and goodne≈ø≈øe, who dur≈øt they, would a≈øwell ≈øhoot out their black tongues again≈øt God, as again≈øt his ≈øervants.</p>

                        <hi>LEt a man ≈øo account of us as the Mini≈øters of Chri≈øt, and Stewards of &amp;c.</hi>] The primitive Chri≈øtians did cleave unto the Apo≈øtles, and were greatly affected to them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Ye received me</hi> (≈øaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>as an Apo≈øtle of God, even as Chri≈øt Je≈øus:</hi> This is a duty the Scripture enjoyns; as there is a duty from a Wife to Husband, from Servant to Ma≈øter, from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Superiour, ≈øo from a People to their Mini≈øter, 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 5.12. ≈øo 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The Elders that rule well, are worthy of double honour, &amp;c.</hi> Many in all their life-time never make any reckoning of them, till pain, grief, and ≈øickne≈ø≈øe enforce them; and then they mu≈øt be ≈øent for, and entreated for coun≈øel and advice, direction, and prayer; and whom they never loved living, they ≈øeem to have re≈øpect to dying: thus the Athenians dealt with <hi>Themi≈øtocles;</hi> they u≈øed him (as he ≈øaith of him≈øelf) like a tree, in fair weather little regarded, but in a ≈øtorm fled to for ≈øhelter; God did give honour to the builders of his mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Tabernacle in calling them by name, <hi>Exod</hi> 35.30.<note place="margin">Barker.</note> and they doe di≈øhonour the builders of his ≈øpiritual Temple in calling them out of their name. You know that in re≈øpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves they have a Commi≈ø≈øion from God, and being commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øionated they are not to be ≈ølighted: though the per≈øon be mean of him≈øelf, his Commi≈ø≈øion gives him worth. And again, in re≈øpect of them≈øelves, they are to be re≈øpected; for, were it not for the Mini≈øtery, you would be debarred of the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of ≈øalvation, be never ≈øhipt with Chri≈øt in Bapti≈øme, ≈øayle with him in the pinnace of the Church, nor anchor at the haven

                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it con≈øi≈øts in the Reverend regard and e≈øtimation of their per≈øons. There is a Thief which entreth not by the door and cometh to de≈øtroy, beware of ≈øuch an one; and there is a good Shepherd, which entreth in at the door, and careth for the ≈øheep: know ≈øuch an one, and account of him, and have him in ≈øingular love for his works ≈øake. Why doth God ≈øtyle them <hi>Angels, Stewards, Amba≈ø≈øadours?</hi> Why doth he parle with them, enter them into commons, make them his fellow-commoners? one main Rea≈øon is, that you ≈øhould with the word have a reverend regard, and e≈øtimation of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the≈øe Exhortations, 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 5.12. <hi>And we be≈øeech you brethren to know them &amp;c. And obey them that have the rule over you,</hi> Heb. 13. ver. 17. It is ob≈øerved that the wor≈øt men of a Pari≈øh regard a Pa≈øtor the lea≈øt; one gives a Rea≈øon; they are like Legs and Arms out of joynt, and ≈øo cannot endure the touch of the Chirurgions hand, who≈øe chief care is to worke their cure. He that is ≈øick of a Lethargie de≈øires to ≈øleep though he die for it, and he that is lulled a≈øleep in ≈øinne cannot away with the Watchman of God. Nothing is a greater trouble to him that loveth ≈øleep than to be kept awake. It maketh the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ≈øoule cry out again≈øt the Mini≈øter, as tho≈øe again≈øt <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 22.22. <hi>Away with ≈øuch a fellow; he troubleth the City, Acts</hi> 16.20. when as they in their carnal ≈øecurity, malice, and envy, are the <hi>Ahabs</hi> that trouble <hi>I≈ørael.</hi> None but the ≈øcum and refu≈øe of people, the mo≈øt carnal-minded, are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel, for from a loathing of their per≈øons, there followeth a dete≈øtation of their doctrine, the in≈øtrument of conver≈øion and means of ≈øalvation; and ≈øo in the end, ruine and de≈øtruction. It is a ≈øad thing that many more affect &amp; take delight in variety of Teachers, than in verity of Doctrine. Brethren, the meane≈øt Preacher whom God hath ≈øent you, can ≈øhew you that, which if you obediently follow,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:168349:91"/>≈øhall effectually ≈øave you. The Word is powerfull, what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument ≈øoever bringeth it; and Gods ≈øtrength is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt in our weakne≈ø≈øe: it is not we by our Learning and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but God by his Spirit that mu≈øt work you to him≈øelf. I have ob≈øerved that this immoderate crying up of ≈øome to be <hi>Elijah</hi>'s and <hi>Eli≈øha</hi>'s to have their ≈øpirits redoubled on them, and the vilifying of others, have been a great cau≈øe of tho≈øe rents among≈øt us; and Factions we may ≈øee thus kindled, which while we live, perhaps we ≈øhall not ≈øee extingui≈øhed. <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollos, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, were ≈øuch cryes as bred in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> ≈øad divi≈øions, and make the Apo≈øtle conclude them not Chri≈øtians, but carnal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.34. <hi>For ye &amp;c.</hi> This way and cour≈øe is a direct oppo≈øition to that unity and unanimity that God would have in his Church; for ob≈øerving rather the diver≈øity of In≈øtructors, than the unity of truth, there ari≈øeth in the end as many mindes as men, as many Sects as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as many Go≈øpels as Go≈ø≈øips; for, ≈øchi≈ømes, here≈øies, di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and confu≈øion, are the effects of Chri≈øtians unchri≈øtian divi≈øions: and therefore if ye would not be thought carnal, cea≈øe from partiality, and carry a loving affection and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able e≈øteem towards all the Servants &amp; Amba≈ø≈øadors of Chri≈øt. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> ≈øo I of them, <hi>Receive them in the Lord with all gladne≈ø≈øe, and hold ≈øuch in reputation,</hi> Phil. 2.29. Doe not di≈øcourage them, either by contempt of their per≈øons, or doctrine. I ≈øpeak not this as to any one particular: I neither ≈øtand or fall, by the opinion of any. When a Mini≈øter fir≈øt ≈øteps into the Mini≈øtery, he is to con≈øider he is as a Lamb among≈øt Wolves. S. <hi>John Bapti≈øt</hi> came neither eating nor drinking, and yet the people ≈øaid, <hi>he had a Devil:</hi> CHRIST came eating and drinking, and they ≈øaid, <hi>he was a glutton, and a wine bibber; The Servant is not greater than his Ma≈øter;</hi> He mu≈øt not (≈øaith S. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome</hi> in his 6. <hi>Hom: de laudibus Pauli</hi>) enter into this high and holy calling, except he be willing to ≈øuffer a thou≈øand deaths. I thought good to let you know your duty in the≈øe times, in which ≈øo much contempt and contumely is thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel, and this high and honourable calling is e≈øteemed ba≈øe and contemptible. We may ju≈øtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain with the Prophet, <hi>We are wearied with men,</hi> I≈øa. 7.13.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:168349:92"/>With the other Prophet, that <hi>We are wondred at,</hi> Zach. 3.8. And with the Apo≈øtle, that <hi>We are made a ≈øpectacle unto the world, to Angels, and to men,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.9. <hi>And are as the filth of the world, and off ≈øcouring of all things unto this day,</hi> ver≈øe 13. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and di≈øobedience of Gods me≈ø≈øage and Me≈ø≈øengers, may be ea≈øily perceived by comparing peoples practi≈øe with our preaching.</p>

Ob≈øerve what inference the Apo≈øtle makes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9, 10, 11. I reade of Chri≈øt (who came to fulfill all Righteou≈øne≈øs) that as he paid tribute unto <hi>Cae≈øar,</hi> ≈øo he offered his duties unto the Temple, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.24.

It was fore≈øeen (no doubt) by Gods Spirit, how the Mini≈øters of the Word ≈øhould be contemned, how injuriou≈øly dealt withall, what havock and ≈øpoyle ≈øhould be made of the Church: which moved him to tho≈øe Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 5.12.

The Merchants trade concerns our bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the Lawers occupation our goods, the Phy≈øitians art our body, all the≈øe have re≈øpect; but the Mini≈øters who have care of ≈øouls, lie di≈øregarded. <hi>Is not the life more worth than meat, and the body than rayment,</hi> Mat. 6. but the ≈øoule more pretious than all, <hi>M√†t.</hi> 16.26? And yet carnal-Go≈øpellers envy not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious wealth of Merchants, of Lawyers, of Phy≈øicians; all is well if the Mini≈øter be poor, decrea≈øe his wages, encrea≈øe his work; get ≈øtraw where he can finde it, yet ≈øhall nothing of his labour be dimini≈øhed. They ≈øeem, I ≈øay, to have put out the very Light of Nature; they repine at the rea≈øonable maintenance of them that mini≈øter before the Lord: For, who plants a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and eats not of the fruits thereof? Or, who feeds a Flock, and eats not of the milke of the Flock? Mark how the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures both in the Law and the Go≈øpel doe beat upon this point: In the Law it is ≈øaid, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox;</hi> doth God take care for Oxen? No, his care is for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9, 10. Mini≈øters maintenance is not <hi>Humanum inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> but <hi>Divinum in≈øtitutum,</hi> ver≈øe 14. And this Law is rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, equitable, ju≈øt, and con≈øcionable; for, if we ≈øow ≈øpiritual things, is it a great matter that we reap carnal things? It is an action that goeth currant without contradiction, <hi>Ju≈øtitia ≈øuum cuique tribuit,</hi> Ju≈øtice giveth to every man that which belongeth unto him: who≈øoever therefore converteth to any prophane u≈øe that which is con≈øecrated to Gods ≈øervice, and for his u≈øe, robs God of his due, and takes his right from him; if you mi≈øpend his Sabbath, that time ≈øet apart for his glory, you rob him; if you make a fal≈øe entry on his free-hold, and prophane the place of his publick wor≈øhip, you rob him. <hi>My hou≈øe ≈øhall be called a hou≈øe of prayer, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 21.13. <hi>Bel≈øhazzar</hi> carow≈øed in the bowles of the Temple, but drank the draughts of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. And if you creep into Gods right, and let them ≈øtarve at the Altar that ≈øerve at the Altar; you rob God, and

Mi≈øerable are they, that eat up ≈øheep and ≈øhepherds both, that grow rich out of the ruines of poor Mini≈øters, that turn <hi>Aram dominicam</hi> into <hi>haram dome≈øticam,</hi> the Lords Sanctuaries into ≈øwine-≈øtyes and ≈øtables. <hi>William Rufus</hi> u≈øed to ≈øay, <hi>Church bread was ≈øweet bread,</hi> but poor King he ≈ømarted for it. <hi>Bal≈øhazzar</hi> took <hi>≈øacrum de ≈øacro, Dan.</hi> 5. but he had better been without it. <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apo≈øtata</hi> took away the Mini≈øters maintenance with intention to de≈øtroy the Mini≈øtery, but ta≈øted of the fearfull hand of God. Oh his death was lamentable! it may well be verified of them all that thus deale, <hi>aurum habent Tholo≈øanum,</hi> it will be ≈øweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe in the mouth, but bitterne≈ø≈øe in the belly; I ≈øpeak this out of love and compa≈ø≈øion to him that is guilty, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of tho≈øe that as yet have not con≈øented to ≈øo great wickedne≈ø≈øe. The que≈øtion was once, <hi>What ≈øhall we bring to the man of God?</hi> Now it is a motion, <hi>What ≈øhall we take away from the man of God?</hi> Oh! be not proud of mi≈øchief, be not fle≈øh't with fortunate wickedne≈ø≈øe, and doe not triumph in unble≈øt gain, for the lo≈øer ≈øhall ≈øit down with content, when the winner ≈øhall lie down in torment, never value that profit, that will in the end prove uncomfortable.

They are
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:168349:94"/>mo≈øt hatefull people to God, and good men, that ≈øet their tougues to ≈øound nothing but detraction and ≈ølanders, as though their mouthes were the dung gate through which the filth of a City was carried forth. <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Pri≈øcilla</hi> ≈øtand for <hi>Paul,</hi> though they doe it with danger of their own lives, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.4.

Much le≈ø≈øe of a Mini≈øter of the Go≈øpel, a Servant, and Amba≈ø≈øadour of Chri≈øt. As thou mu≈øt not be a nur≈øe of his ill fame, ≈øo let there be no room in thy heart to receive any report, for he that opens his mouth to detraction, is a thief, and he that opens his ears to entertain it, is a Receiver, and both of them carry the Devil with them, the one in his tongue, the other, in his eares; it is a true ≈øaying, <hi>There would not be ≈øo many Thieves, if there were not ≈øo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers:</hi> Even ≈øo, there would not ≈øo many rob the renown of his Mini≈øter, and clip his credit to make him lighter e≈øteemed, were it not that the Hearers open their eares to receive untrue and malitious reports.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:168349:95"/>the condition of many, how are they to≈øt from po≈øt to pillar, but e≈øpecially Mini≈øters, who lie liable to the greate≈øt per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and tho≈øe as thick as the fiery Serpents in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, with their venemous, and burning ≈øtings?

You have a ≈øort of men that delight in per≈øecution, it is their meat and drink; a mo≈øt unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian quality and unlike God, who bids us <hi>be mercifull as. he is mercifull,</hi> Luke 6.36. where you have a precept <hi>[Be ye merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,]</hi> a pattern, (and it is the be≈øt) <hi>[as your &amp;c.] As</hi> is a note of quality, not equality: we cannot equall God in love, for all our mercifulne≈ø≈øe is finite, his towards us infinite; and this is ≈øeen fir≈øt in his pitty, <hi>he is pittifull,</hi> None ever could ju≈øtly charge God of rigour, there is mercy even in Hell: pittiful he is <hi>in corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo, Not breaking the brui≈øed reed, nor &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, his mercy is ≈øeen in his bounty, bountiful he is in <hi>porrigendo,</hi> giving to all, life, breath, and all things: as the mercies of the wicked are full of cruelty, the very judgments of God upon his ≈øervants are full of mercy: whence then proceeds that envy and cruelty in men? he ≈øpareth them in mercy, who in their malice neither ≈øpare God, nor men. Oh that men ≈øhould doe the works of the fle≈øh, and yet ≈øeem to live after the ≈øpirit! for ≈øo is hatred, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, emulations, wrath, ≈øtrife, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. <hi>The works of the fle≈øh</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>are manife≈øt,</hi> which are the≈øe, ver≈øe 19.

Be≈øide all this, it is apparent that unmercifulne≈ø≈øe and cruelty is of the Devil; It is true, he can transform him≈øelf into an Angel of Light, and rather than
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:168349:95"/>not draw men to Hell, he will di≈ø≈øemble a love to Heaven: he will ≈øpeak good, that he may work evil; and confe≈ø≈øe the truth, that he may deceive with fal≈øhood: he is full of ≈øubtilty, and cruelty, <hi>a Murtherer from the beginning:</hi> Though he play the Fox, yet he ends with the Lyon; blood, ma≈ø≈øacres, and de≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are his ≈øofte≈øt embraces; horrour, and amazement, the plea≈øures of his court; kill and ≈ølay, the language of his tongue; you ≈øee God and Chri≈øt give no ≈øuch pattern.

                     <p>Thirdly, you have the per≈øons again≈øt whom this In≈øurrection is made, <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Magi≈øtrate and Mini≈øter.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Grievance; their u≈øurping of Rule over the people, <hi>You take too much &amp;c.</hi> and not onely U≈øurpation, but Intru≈øion too, <hi>Why lift ye up your ≈øelves?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, you have the ground of this Grievance, <hi>the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is holy, every one of them, and what need of</hi> Aaron? <hi>the Lord is amongst them, what needs a Governour or</hi> Mo≈øes? Here were glorious ≈øhews, and pretences: they charge <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> with Ambition and Intru≈øion, Vice rebukes Virtue, Humility challengeth Arrogance; when as their main end was to ru≈øh into their rooms, to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe them≈øelves of their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Now ob≈øerve, all this is not again≈øt them, but again≈øt God; the abu≈øe and affront offered to them, he takes as a di≈øhonour to him≈øelfe. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>What are we? your murmurings, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore he plagueth them in a ≈øtrange and unu≈øual manner, to be En≈øamples to us, that we ≈øhould fear, and not doe ≈øo wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Their intent of a ≈øubver≈øion of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ends in the de≈øtruction of them≈øelves, <hi>for the Earth openeth her mouth, and ≈øwalloweth them down quick:</hi> We ≈øhould never read of this judgment, but it ≈øhould make us tremble, and pray that thus we may not ≈øin.

It is common for the ≈øons of <hi>Belial</hi> to lay nets and ≈ønares to entrap the Prophets of the Lord. How great a ≈øin this is, hear what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 4.8. <hi>He that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth, despi≈øeth not man, but God &amp;c.</hi> Ob≈øerve the words: this Argument is a Conclu≈øion of the former Rea≈øons, enforcing them all (≈øaith <hi>Zanchy</hi> on this place) as if he ≈øhould ≈øay, It is not I <hi>Paul</hi> that exhort you, but Chri≈øt, and Chri≈øt is not onely man but God: he that willeth Sanctification is God, he that is an avenger of Fornication, and Covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe, is God, he that calleth unto this holine≈ø≈øe is God: he therefore that de≈øpi≈øeth our admonition in this ca≈øe, de≈øpi≈øeth not man but God.

                        </gap>, if we tran≈ølate with <hi>Marl:</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> [God hath given us his holy Spirit] then <hi>Pauls</hi> argument is thus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; he that de≈øpi≈øeth us, de≈øpi≈øeth not man but God, for we write not out of our own authority, but as in≈øpird by the ble≈ø≈øed Spirit which is God. If according to the be≈øt Copies [God hath ≈øent his holy Spirit among you] then the Apo≈øtle thus argueth, God hath ≈øent his Spirit to this end, that you may di≈øcern ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification to be his will. His Spirit is our keeper, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Our Comforter, <hi>John</hi> 14. Our Teacher, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. and therefore quench not the Spirit, in endeavouring to quench the gifts of the Spirit. He that ≈øtoppeth his ears, and hardneth his heart in the Preachers Exhortation by the Lord Je≈øus, little regardeth the will and word of God, de≈øpi≈øeth not man, but God. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpi≈øe him not at your perill, you de≈øpi≈øe God him≈øelf, and you ≈øhall not go Scot-free, on your ≈øouls be it that hear me this day, who≈øe Table-talke is furni≈øhed with je≈øts and invectives again≈øt Mini≈øters, and who≈øe ≈øtudy is how to vex, afflict, and torment them. <hi>Themi≈øtocles</hi> was ever bani≈øhed in peace, but ≈øent for home in warre. We are pa≈ø≈øed over in the daies of pride as u≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe creatures, but when the wrath of God falls on their naked con≈øcience, then the Mini≈øter is thought on; when your pul≈øe beats ≈øickly, and you lie on your groaning beds, then are they intreated for coun≈øell and advi≈øe.</p>
                     <p>What a madne≈ø≈øe is it to contemn tho≈øe living whom (if God own you in mercy) you will love dying. I am ≈øick, and like to die, is there no balm in <hi>Gilead?</hi> is there no Phy≈øitian there? tell ≈øome tydings from heaven, ≈øome comfortable things of <hi>Sion,</hi> I be≈øeech you: you are the Amba≈ø≈øadours of Chri≈øt, and bring the glad tydings of peace, and is there no comfort, no peace for me? thus they, that in fair weather beat us, in foule run for ≈øhelter to us. We ≈øhall be thought to be good Mini≈øters, untill unplea≈øing things drop from us, and then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well good conceit, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ≈øpake merrily of the Heathen, Unle≈ø≈øe God plea≈øe man, he ≈øhall be God no longer.

                     <p>Fir≈øt, you are but men, it is true; yet men of God, called and deputed his Officers and Amba≈ø≈øadours, intru≈øted with high, and holy my≈øteries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let a man &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>A third is Sophi≈øtry, fraud, and cunning; Mo≈øt men ≈øtrive how to ≈øupplant and overthrow one another, to undermine the walls of innocency; plain dealing is dead, and (which is to be lamented) it died without i≈ø≈øue; Once <hi>Orbis ingemuit factum ≈øe videre Arianum,</hi> The world groaned ≈øeeing it ≈øelfe made an Arian: It may now groane, <hi>Factum ≈øe videns Machiavellum,</hi> Seeing it ≈øelfe made a <hi>Machiavell:</hi> this is that fal≈øe key that

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:168349:101"/>coats of Sheep, with Devils in the habit of Angels, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea≈øonable, and wicked men, and mu≈øt therefore expect per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but alas poor ≈øoules! they doe not ≈øo much wrong us as them≈øelves, they foam out their own ≈øhame, and bewray their wretched, I had almo≈øt ≈øaid, reprobate malice; ≈øuch as ≈øit down in the ≈øeat of the ≈øcornfull, make a low ≈øtep to damnation, God will laugh tho≈øe to ≈øcorn that laugh his to ≈øcorn, and de≈øpi≈øe tho≈øe that de≈øpi≈øe us, <hi>in expuentis recidit faciem, quod in Coelum expuit,</hi> That which a man ≈øpits again≈øt Heaven, ≈øhall fall back on his own face. Tho≈øe indignities done to the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel ≈øhall not ≈øleep in the du≈øt, but ≈øtand up in judgment. Never was any truth ≈øo happily innocent, as to maintain it ≈øelfe free from calumny and abu≈øe. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was a faithfull, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Preacher, yet was ≈ølanderou≈øly reported, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. The be≈øt truths are ≈øubject to mi≈øinterpretation, and there is not any doctrine ≈øo firmly grounded, and warily delivered whereupon calumny will not fa≈øten, and ≈øtick ≈ølanderous imputations. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iohns</hi> mourning, nor <hi>Chri≈øts</hi> piping can pa≈ø≈øe the pikes, but the one hath a Devil, and the other is a Drunkard, and a Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibber; <hi>Iohn the Bapti≈øt</hi> came neither eating, nor drinking, and yet the people ≈øaid he had a Devil, and Chri≈øt came both eating and drinking, &amp;c. The Servant is not greater than his Ma≈øter, neither an Amba≈ø≈øadour greater than he that ≈øent him; if they have called the Ma≈øter of the hou≈øe <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> how much more them of the hou≈øhold? <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.25. If Chri≈øts doctrine did not? think we the doctrine of his Mini≈øters, and Servants can e≈øcape the ≈øtroak of mens tongues? Chri≈øt came to fulfill the Law, and yet he was accu≈øed to be a de≈øtroyer of the Law; he decides the que≈øtion for Cae≈øar, <hi>Give unto Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øar &amp;c.</hi> and yet they charge him as if he ≈øpake again≈øt Cae≈øar, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.12. The book of the <hi>Acts</hi> doth witne≈ø≈øe how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles were ≈ølandered as Seducers, Sectaries, vain-Bablers, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Broachers of new, fal≈øe, and pe≈øtilent Doctrines. Nor did the Devil here leave off, for if we read the Apologies of <hi>Athenagoras, Tertullian,</hi> and others, it will amaze us to ≈øee what bla≈øphemous ≈øeditions, horrible and odious impieties were fathered upon the antient Chri≈øtian Doctors; tho≈øe perillous times in≈øtant in the daies of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> are become extant in our
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:168349:101"/>Age, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. Some turn to the doctrine of Devils, Others ≈øtart a≈øide to Schi≈øme, few love Religion in ≈øincerity, and the high, and honourable calling of the Mini≈øtery is vile, ba≈øe, and contemptible. Now what are the Rea≈øons or grounds of this contempt, and de≈øpi≈øing of the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel? 1. They di≈øcover the filthine≈ø≈øe, and unmask the hypocri≈øie of the ≈øons of men, and ≈øo rai≈øe all the furies of hell again≈øt them: It is ob≈øerved the wor≈øt men of a Pari≈øh regard a good Pa≈øtor and his Doctrine the lea≈øt, for they are like Legs and Arms out of joynt, and ≈øo cannot endure the touch of the Chirurgeons hand, who≈øe chiefe≈øt care is to work their cure: they are to reprove and rebuke, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. to root up, and throw down, <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.10. Men will raile, and rage, pro≈øecute, and per≈øecute tho≈øe that would pull down and overthrow their plea≈øant, delightfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and profitable ≈øinnes. The rea≈øon of this contempt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from that cur≈øed nature of man, who is an enemy again≈øt all good, and <hi>I≈øhmael</hi>-like per≈øecutes the truth, and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of it. <hi>Come let us imagine ≈øome devi≈øes, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 18. ver≈øe 18. It is de≈øperate wickedne≈ø≈øe to contend with tho≈øe that ju≈øtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove you, to expo≈øtulate with them, ca≈øt reproaches in their teeth, and lay to their charge, what you your ≈øelves are mo≈øt guilty of. Thus dealt <hi>Corah</hi> and his Complices, with <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Numb.</hi> 16 <hi>Ahab</hi> with <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. The I≈øraelites with <hi>Ieremiah, Ier.</hi> 18. <hi>Amaziah</hi> with <hi>Amos, Am.</hi> 7. And the Scribes and Phari≈øees with our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.24. What a prepo≈øterous thing is it, that the Hand or Foot ≈øhould guide the Eye? The Childe rebuke the Father, the Patient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Phy≈øician, the Scholler check his School-Ma≈øter, and the Sheep quarrell with the Shepherd? no le≈ø≈øe prepo≈øterous is it for a people to in≈øtruct their In≈øtructor, and le≈ø≈øon tho≈øe that ≈øhould le≈ø≈øon them. This contempt proceeds from a cur≈øed heart, and is a ≈øigne of de≈øperate wickedne≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to bring all to a triplicity. This contempt of the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel may be imputed,</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, to Sathan, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>, that <hi>calumniator,</hi> who out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to the preaching would bring a loathing of truth; he is the Father of Lyes, the Prince of Darkne≈øs, and therefore hates Truth and Light, the Me≈ø≈øage and the Me≈ø≈øengers.</p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:168349:102"/>
                     <p>Secondly, it may be imputed to man, partly to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding when the judgment it ≈øelf is weak, or weakned through prejudice: Or el≈øe to the Will, men of corrupt mindes; or to the affections overcome by carnall, and ≈øeeming ≈øhews: Or to malitious wickedne≈ø≈øe, and this is very dangerous, God will hardly forgive tho≈øe that ≈øin of malitious wickedne≈ø≈øe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it may be imputed to God, not cau≈øing, but permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ≈øuffering,</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, out of ju≈øtice, as a fearfull Judgment upon wicked ones, and to render them lyable to the greate≈øt and ≈øore≈øt puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, out of triall of faithfull, painfull Teachers; not to be di≈ømaid though briars and thorns be again≈øt them, but to evidence their con≈øtancy and ≈øincerity, and how they live above all the ≈øcorn, and contempt of men, willing to ≈øuffer not the lo≈ø≈øe of reputation, but a thou≈øand deaths. I ≈øhould now come to ≈øeverall U≈øes; but I will ≈øumme them up in two.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt is by way of encouragement to ≈øuch as are per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is their Ma≈øters, and the Churches Lot, a Condition from which they cannot plead exemption: If all that live godly mu≈øt ≈øuffer per≈øecution, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. in vain doe the Preachers of Righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe think to e≈øcape, and not drink of Chri≈øts cup. God hath made us a gazing-≈øtock to men and Angels. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øius</hi> was nick-named <hi>Sathana≈øius, Cyprian</hi> called <hi>Caprian, Paul</hi> accounted mad, and Chri≈øt him≈øelfe reputed a Conjurer. We mu≈øt not fear, if Bryars and Thorns be again≈øt us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.6. but encourage our ≈øelves in the Lord our God, and con≈øider him that underwent the contradiction of ≈øinners.</p>
                     <p>A ≈øecond is of bearing patiently injuries, and they are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, Per≈øonal or Mini≈øterial; what concerneth his per≈øon, and what his calling. An indignity that onely toucheth our private per≈øon mu≈øt be borne, as S. <hi>Augu≈øt:</hi> replied to railing <hi>Petilian, Po≈ø≈øumus e≈ø≈øe in his pariter copio≈øi, ≈øed nolimus e≈ø≈øe pariter vani,</hi> He could be as full as he, but would not be ≈øo vain. The be≈øt Apologie to ≈øcorn, and petulancy, is patience, and ≈øilence; but when ≈ølanders redound to the di≈øcredit of their profe≈ø≈øion, and calling, it behoves us not to be ≈øilent: When <hi>Fe≈øtus</hi> ≈øcorned <hi>Paul</hi> as a mad man, he an≈øwered, <hi>I am not mad, oh noble
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:168349:102"/>Fe≈øtus, but &amp;c.</hi> And the primitive Chri≈øtians often did Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize in defence of them≈øelves when truth was wounded through their ≈øides. It is ob≈øerved by divers Divines that when as the Jewes objected again≈øt Chri≈øt, two crimes, one that <hi>he was a Samaritane,</hi> an irreligious vile per≈øon; and another, that <hi>he had a Devil:</hi> he neglects the fir≈øt concerning his per≈øon, and ≈øtands upon that e≈øpecially which touched his doctrine; he an≈øwered, <hi>I have not a Devil, Ioh.</hi> 8.49. Chri≈øt accu≈øed of <hi>blasphemy</hi> did ever Apologize for him≈øelfe: zealous we ought to be for God, how≈øoever remi≈ø≈øe in what concerneth our ≈øelves. It was the ≈øaying of a Father, He would rather lo≈øe his life, than ≈øuffer one ≈øyllable of Gods holy truth to be betrayed. <hi>Meam injuriam patienter tuli, injuriam contra spon≈øam Chri≈øti ferre non potui,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Hierome.</hi> Our own injuries we mu≈øt bury in forgetfulne≈ø≈øe; but wrongs to the truth of God, and Go≈øpel of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, we mu≈øt not put up. And further he ≈øaith, <hi>in crimine haere≈øeos ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem oportet e≈ø≈øe pat√¨entem,</hi> When any is accu≈øed of here≈øie or ≈øchi≈øme, he ought by no means to put it up in ≈øilence, but make his lawfull defence. <hi>Hier: ad Pamma.</hi> I might here fall to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deplore the ≈øtate and condition of this Age, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øcarcely any Religion but what is tainted with a ≈øpice of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor any encouragement to Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel, unle≈øs ≈øchi≈ømaticall Novelli≈øts the bane of Church and State.</p>
