            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Though every man cannot bring gold, and ſilver to the Temple, yet cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer mettall may ſerve: as for the plainneſſe of the matter, it ſuits with the ſubject; and you know plain lines doe beſt anſwer a ſtraight and even levell.<note n="*" place="margin">Politian.

                  <p>He that hath fine words, words void of matter, is (as <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaketh) like the childe that bloweth in a little ſhell a
<pb facs="tcp:168349:8"/>great Bubble, which is ſo vain that it is marr'd aſſoon as made. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Rule hath been mine, Rather to ſpeak that the meanest may conceive, than the Eloquent commend. I have not ſought after vain flouriſhes, and Rhetoricall ornaments, but have preferred matter and truth, before words and phraſes: if words follow the matter they are welcome; but if they muſt be pumpt for, fare them well. It is ſaid of one that loved <hi>Ennius,</hi> that when he read him, he gathered <hi>Aurum ex Sterquilinio,</hi> Gold out of a Dunghill. For, it is ſaid of him, that he was <hi>ingenio magnus,</hi> but <hi>arte rudis.

                     <hi>Aeneas Silvius</hi> uſed to ſay, that there is no Book ſo weakly written, but that it containeth one thing or other which is profitable.

                  <p>For the cenſure of this carping Age, whoſe little judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is accompanied with leſſe honeſty, I value not a ruſh; I paſſe very little to be judged of them. <hi>Si rectè facis, quid cos vereris qui non rectè reprehendunt?</hi> If thou doest rightly, why ſhouldeſt thou feare them that blame wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully? There are ſome, ſaith <hi>S. Hierome, Qu bene loqui non poſſunt, maledicere non ceſſant,</hi> Cannot ſpeak well, ceaſe not to ſpeak evil. You know the Miniſters of the Goſpel, eſpecially they that preach powerfully, are expoſed to much ſcorn, and contumely: but alas! they doe not ſo much wrong us as themſelves; they foame out their owne ſhame and bewray their wretched, I had almoſt ſaid, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate malice. For, ſuch as ſit down in the ſeat of the ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:168349:8"/>make a low ſtep to their own damnation. I beſeech you, esteem not thoſe lightly that are the true Ministers of Chriſt, and have them in eſtimation for their works ſake. But Wolves that come to you in Sheeps cloathing, beware of them, becauſe they doe not lead you, but ſeduce you; you may know them by three ſignes eſpecially:</p>
                  <p>Firſt by their doubling, being like cunning Jugglers, whoſe meaning may be turned this way, or that way, like a Noſe of Wax.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, their love to the World, more than the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and comfort of their Flock, uſing baſe indirect means for the advancement of their ſelf-ends.</p>

The names of the Authours out of whom I have gathered any thing, I have, for the moſt part, expreſſed: partly to give them their due, and that their authority might procure freer paſſage.</p>
                  <p>There is a Generation of men, who, to be reputed ſomething, cenſure other mens endeavours, as nothing. They think their Conſcience beſt diſcharged, when they have moſt reviled: as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaid of <hi>Helvidius,
<pb facs="tcp:168349:10"/>Maledicere omnibus bonae Conſcientiae ſignum arbitratur;</hi> Like the Lyndians, who think they worſhip <hi>Hercules</hi> the beſt when they raile the faſteſt. It is an eaſie thing by miſconſtruction to deprave whatſoever is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently done or ſpoken. Never was any truth ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily innocent, as to maintain it ſelf free from calumny and abuſe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> a ſaithfull, and painfull Preacher, yet was ſlanderouſly reported, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. There is not any doctrine ſo firmly grounded, and warily delivered, whereupon calumny will not faſten and ſtick ſlanderous imputations. Thoſe indignities offered to the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhall not ſleep in the duſt, but riſe up in judgment againſt them. <hi>In expuentis recidet faciem quod in Coelum expuit,</hi> That which a man ſpits againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhall fall back upon his face.</p>
                  <p>When it was told <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that one railed on him behinde his back: When I am away, ſaith he, let him beat me too. <hi>Beza</hi>'s anſwer to a Spaniſh Jeſuit is worth our obſervation, and worthy our imitation, who diſputing about the Euchariſt, called him and <hi>Calvin, Vulpes, Serpentes, &amp; Simias,</hi> Foxes, Serpents, and Apes. To which he anſwereth, <hi>Non magis nos credere, quàm tranſubſtantiationem,</hi> We no more believe it than tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. The beſt Apologie to ſcorn and petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy, is patience and ſilence: but if ſlanders redound to the diſcredit of our holy profeſſion and calling, and truth comes to be wounded through our ſides, then to hold our peace is ſinfull. <hi>Meam injuriam patienter tuli; injuriam contra ſponſam Chriſti ferre non potui.</hi> Our own injuries we muſt bury in forgetfulneſſe; but wrongs to the truth of God, and Goſpel of Chriſt, we muſt not put up.

                     <p>A ſecond thing in which this Office chiefly conſiſts, is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in praying for and with the people, <hi>James</hi> 5.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 6.4. The Miniſters are Gods mouth to the people, and for the people; to them in conſtant preaching, for them in fervent praying. If people riſe up againſt their Paſtors, let their Paſtors fall on their faces for the people: Thus did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Samuel</hi> little leſſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23.

He that bids <hi>despiſe not prophecying,</hi> ſaith in the ſame Chapter, <hi>pray continually,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.

It was the laudable and commendable cuſtome of the Church to begin with prayer, <hi>Almighty and moſt mercifull Father, &amp;c.</hi> Every important action requires prayer, much more the preaching of the word. Thoſe that repreſent God, and carry his meſſage to the world, ſhould be conſecrated by publick devotions; private prayer is commendable, but publick much more; pure hands are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in every place, but eſpecially in the Sanctuary. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that made heaven and earth, bleſſe thee out of Sion;</hi> he ſaith not, The Lord that made heaven bleſſe thee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, nor the Lord that made earth bleſſe thee out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but the Lord that made heaven and earth bleſſe thee out of <hi>Sion:</hi> bleſſings come originally from Heaven, mediately through <hi>Sion.</hi>

                     <p>Now that prayer may have acceptance, there is required: Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that it be made in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, through whom our perſons are accepted, and all our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances are as ſweet ſmelling incenſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.</p>

Therefore for this purpoſe are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters called, namely, to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt unto the faithful, and to adminiſter the Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>For this function is to be given to none,<note place="margin">Art. 17.</note> whom the Miniſters and they to whom this charge is committed by the Church, doe not finde and judge to be skilful in the Law of God,<note place="margin">Form Confeſ. of <hi>Helv.</hi> of the Miniſt. of the word.</note> to be of blameleſſe life, and to bear a ſingular affection to the name of Chriſt; which, ſeeing it is the true Election of God, is rightly allowed by the conſent of the Church, and by the laying on of the hands of the Prieſt.</p>

A Miniſter (and not a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) repreſents the perſon of Chriſt in the Sacrament, whoſe Deputy and Ambaſſadour he is; and therefore he onely can offer and deliver with power and authority the outward ſigne which anſwereth fitly to the inward matter, for he onely hath the key of binding and looſing, a power that no Lay-man hath. If you look unto men by whom this power is adminiſtred, it is a meer Miniſtery; but if you look unto Chriſt, it is a moſt high authority, than which there is on earth none greater, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, or more excellent. There are two keys, the binding
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168349:28"/>and looſing, in regard of the divers objects and effects. The looſing key is that part of the Miniſtery whereby remiſſion of ſins or abſolution from ſins in the name of Chriſt is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto the Believers according to Gods word publickly or privately: and ſo Heaven is opened and the Believer looſed by the preaching of the Goſpel, from the bonds of ſin, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an heir of life. The binding key is that other part of the Miniſtery, whereby the retention of their ſins is denounced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Unbelievers and diſobedient, and ſo Heaven is ſhut unto them, and they are bound, that is, they remain captiv'd in the chains of ſin, and are adjudged to damnation, unleſſe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance follow; and theſe keys are of that weight, and efficacy, that whoſoever is remitted or retained on Earth is alſo remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and retained in Heaven, according to that <hi>John</hi> 20.23. <hi>whoſe ſins ye remit &amp;c.</hi> None muſt imagine that this power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the perſon or worthineſſe of the Miniſter (for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed properly he can neither binde nor looſe any man) but it depends upon his lawful Miniſtery, or rather upon God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who by the holy Ghoſt is powerful in the Miniſtery of the word, as often as the Miniſter doth duely execute his office: in this ſenſe, theſe two places are reconciled, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.7. <hi>Who can forgive ſins, but God alone?</hi> that is <hi>authoritative;</hi> and that of <hi>John</hi> 20.23. <hi>Whoſe ſins ye remit &amp;c.</hi> namely, inſtrumentally; therefore (ſaith <hi>Atterſol.</hi>) Take away the Miniſter, and it is no Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> a private man hath no power of Conſecration, without which the water is but common water,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Atterſ.</hi> 1 book c 5. of the Sac. in generall.</note> and this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to the ſubſtance of the Sacrament; for when the word is added to the Element, then there is made a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now the Sacramental word conſiſts partly of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment proper and peculiar to Miniſters, <hi>Go teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> partly of a promiſe annexed, <hi>in the name of the Father &amp;c.</hi> In all the Scripture we never reade of either command or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe warranting the uſe of Baptiſme by Lay-perſons; without the power of Conſecration, Sacraments are as a dead body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life, as a dumb ſhew without voice, as an empty cloud with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water, and as a barren tree without fruit, idle and dumb ſigns.

Without this it hath no power, force and vertue:<note place="margin">1 book. ch. 4.</note> and if this be wanting, there is no Sacrament: for Baptiſm is no Sacrament, except the word be joyned to it and conſecrated to that uſe.

                        <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and others of the Fathers are of opinion, that <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme and Chriſts were different. But <hi>Zanchy, Bucanus,</hi> and our later Divines are of opinion that <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme and Chriſts are the ſame, In the Author, ſubſtance, doctrine, ſigne, ceremony, effect, or ſignification, for the ſame Sacrament is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of God, and the ſame forgiveneſſe of ſins, and grace of the holy Ghoſt is ſignified, offered, and ſealed: whether it be <hi>John</hi> that adminiſters, the Apoſtles, or ſucceeding Miniſters. The only difference is touching the circumſtance and manner of the manifeſting of Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> baptized into him which came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after him, that is to ſay, into Chriſt which ſhould ſhortly ſuffer, and riſe again; but the Apoſtles, and after them all Miniſters, baptize into Chriſt that hath ſuffered and is riſen again. But againſt this truth the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> thunders, If any ſhall ſay that the Baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> hath the ſame force with Chriſts baptiſm, Let him be accurſed. But for all this, it is a truth:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> We have the ſame doctrine, the ſame word, the ſame
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:168349:29"/>promiſe, the ſame repentance, the ſame forgiveneſſe of ſins, the ſame element of water.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> was conſecrated in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The outward form of Baptiſme was the ſame; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for as he baptized with the ſame matter, why ſhould we imagine he obſerved not the ſame form that Chriſt commanded to his Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles rebaptized any that were baptized with the Miniſtery of <hi>John. Apollos</hi> that was baptized with <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme, we read not that he was baptized again.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If a difference, then Chriſt was baptized with another baptiſme than we are, or he himſelf commanded. Our baptiſme was ſanctified in the perſon of Chriſt; the members have the ſame baptiſme with the head.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Chriſt himſelf teſtifieth, that the baptiſme adminiſtred by <hi>John</hi> portained to the fulfilling of all righteouſneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15. And <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifieth that the Publicans being baptized of him juſtified God; but the Phariſees deſpiſed the counſel of God againſt themſelves and were not baptized, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29. It is very evident that Chriſts and <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme was the ſame, that is, but <hi>one baptiſme,</hi> and therefore whoſoever obſerves not Chriſts inſtitution, but baptizeth contrary to his injunction (for ſo doth a private perſon) brings in a baptiſme different from Chriſts, overthroweth this <hi>one,</hi> and ſo maketh <hi>none.</hi>

                     <p>I ſhall here briefly diſcover to you the greatneſſe of their ſin that thruſt themſelves into the calling of the Miniſtery without lawfull ordination, or deputation thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it is repugnant to the Word of God, For none but ſuch as are called according to the rules and cannons of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ought to take upon them this Office: No man, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> although he be more wiſe than <hi>Salomon,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> ought to take this honour unto himſelf except he be called of God as <hi>Aaron</hi> was, <hi>Heb</hi> 5.4. though not called immediately by himſelf, yet mediately by Deputies under him. <hi>Titus</hi> was to ordain Elders in every City, <hi>Tit</hi> 1.5.

This ſinne that we are now upon, is one of thoſe many, that hales down judgments upon this Land.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it croſſes the cuſtome of the Churches of God, thoſe I meane purged from ſuperſtition, who with one conſent hold forth this doctrine; that it is not lawfull for any man to take upon him the office of publique praying, or Miniſtring the Sacraments, before he be lawfully called and ſent to execute the ſame, witneſſe the confeſſion of all the Reformed Churches. Whoſoever is guilty in this particular, we may ſay of him, we
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:168349:31"/>have no ſuch cuſtome, no nor the Churches of God: St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> propoſeth a rule, and I think it is a good one, and it is this, he that goeth againſt Reaſon is no wiſe man, he that goeth againſt the Scripture is no ſober man, and he that goeth againſt the Church is no peaceable man; and it is obſerved if any make his entrance unlawfull, his courſe and progreſſe is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; it is a ſtep to much Schiſm and Faction.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is a breach of that order God hath enjoyned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for what greater diſorder ſaith a Reverend Doctor can there be, then without order to uſurp the Miniſteriall function? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better becommeth us then order.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168349:32"/>unwaſhen hands; for what is it to enter into the Miniſtery, but to enter into the preſence of the great King? If God rebuked <hi>Moſes</hi> for ſtepping too haſtily to the buſh where his preſence was, how will God check the conſciences of ſuch as careleſly ruſh into the Miniſtery and to Gods holy Table, where God is preſent in a farre more excellent manner than he was in the buſh?

                     <p>Fiftly, it is a mocking of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to pretend a Commiſſion and have it not; to ſeem to do Gods publique work without a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; to put their hands to the plough, and not ſent by him. <hi>Accipite,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Receive the holy Ghoſt,</hi> not <hi>aſſumite,</hi> Take it to your ſelves: it is ſad, and to be lamented, when men make ſin a trifle, and mock God to ſerve their own turns, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21.</p>

As the workmen that builded the Arke prepared a meanes to ſave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but were drowned themſelves.

                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that which is proper to God ought not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the creature.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the ſubject of grace is not the body onely, but the ſpirit: Therefore the Sacraments doe not by their own virtue work any thing as flowing from their eſſence, but miniſterially or inſtrumentally, onely effectually, ſo farre forth as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and nouriſh our faith. Not by any inward power or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their own, but by virtue of the principall Agent or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, they being means, helps, and inſtruments of ſalvation, in which ſenſe the Church is ſaid to be ſanctified, and waſhed in the laver of water through the word, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.16.

Grace is not contained and ſhut up in them as water in a veſſel, or as a medicine in a box; therefore the bare want of it cannot bring the danger of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condemnation: yet let men beware of putting a ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and eſtimation on them, for they are Gods ordinances appointed by him, to which we muſt neither make addition nor ſubſtraction.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper is a ſpeciall part of the Miniſteriall Office, that it ought not to be neglected or laid aſide. Severall Reaſons ſhewing that the long Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it is unwarrantable.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe cloth of gold with which the Church is apparelled is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed. The hand that putteth on this goodly Garment is faith; and the Sacraments confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our faith in Chriſt, are the buttons, as it were, claſping the cloake cloſe to the ſoul. We have already clearely proved that it is the office of the Miniſter of the Goſpell, and to him it properly belongeth to preach the word and Adminiſter the Sacraments. Having ſpoken of Baptiſme I ſhall now preſume to offer ſomething concerning the Lords Supper. God in all ages hath given his Church outward repreſentations and viſible ſignes of inward, ſpirituall, and heavenly things: ſuch were the tree of Life, and the tree of Knowledge of good, and evil; The ratifying his Covenant to the Jewes by Circumciſion, and the Paſſeover; and to us by Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper; which as viſible Sermons preach unto us the love of God, and give aſſurance of his promiſes: his Word is the Evidence, his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ts the Seals; and what is promiſed by the one, is ſealed by the other. God did not think his outward word ſufficient, but alſo added this Sacrament of his laſt Supper, for our further aſſurance, and confirmation, a teſtimony of his faithfulneſſe, a pledge of his promiſes, a token of unmeaſurable love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt all carnall doubting and diſtruſt; having not only his hand writing, but ſeale, from whence the faithful ſoul draws an argument of much comfort and ſpiritual conſolation; here are not onely promiſes, but the writing of God, the oath of God, and the ſeale of God for confirmation. The Sacrament of the Lords Supper doth more clearly and fully (conſidering the manner of working) repreſent and paint out before us the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168349:37"/>love of God in Chriſt, than the word doth; for we doe not only hear of Chriſt, but as it were, ſee, handle, touch, and taſte him. Now the Lord hath ordained Officers, Keepers of his great Seal whom he hath deputed, and ſet apart to this very end, to ſeale his promiſes and Covenant-graces to every believing ſubject. And therefore if any (ſo deputed) ſhall through pride, envy, or any ſiniſter reſpects &amp; groundleſs excuſes no waies warrantable refuſe to put to this Seal for that uſe and purpoſe God intended it, is guilty of no ſmall crime, and deſerveth juſtly to bear Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice no longer. At my coming to this place I did upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſome godly Chriſtians (conſidering the long omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Sacrament) adminiſter the Lords Supper, yet not without many praevious Sermons made for the inſtruction and preparation of my Congregation, at which ſome more preciſe than wiſe, took offence; and whereas it was intended as a bond for further communion, it was made uſe of to a finall ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and my practiſe extremely condemned, and my perſon expoſed to much calumny, being the beginning of a ſad perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. I muſt crave ſome time to vindicate my practiſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving by Gods aſſiſtance that <hi>truth</hi> ſhall never ſuffer by my negligence or cowardize: as I long ſince ſatisfied my ſelf, ſo I hope I ſhall ſatisfie others in this particular. What I did in giving the Sacrament to all indifferently, muſt be conſidered in a time when there was no government or diſcipline in the Church. I ſhall humbly propoſe</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whether the practiſe of ſuch Miniſters as for a long time omit the giving of the Lords Supper where there are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects capable of receiving it; <hi>viz:</hi> (both knowing and godly Chriſtians) be warrantable or not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I ſhall lay before you ſuch Reaſons as are alledged for the omiſſion of it. Concerning the firſt, I reſolve upon the holding the Queſtion negatively, That the practiſe of ſuch as for a long time omit the giving of the Lords Supper, where there are ſubjects capable is not warrantable, and that upon theſe enſuing grounds:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the long omiſſion puts a barre to a Chriſtians thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, for one end of the Lords Supper is to ſhew forth with thankſgiving the death, croſſe, and ſufferings of Chriſt: when
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:168349:38"/>we read or hear of Chriſts paſſion we are greatly affected, but much more when he is ſet before our eyes, and viſibly crucified in our ſight, this extremely moves devout affections, and leaves behinde deep impreſſions: No action more than this ſets out before us the great love and goodneſſe of Chriſt our Saviour, in which, every believing ſoule muſt needs acknowledge the depth of Gods mercy and love, who through Chriſt was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us miſerable ſinners, enters into a League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be our God, and ſeales his grace and unſpeakable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by this Sacrament; he loves us living and dying, and leaves a perpetuall commemoration of his love to mankinde, being in this exhibited not onely to the eare, but eye and caſte, which affords exquiſite fruition and delight. This Sacrament is not a naked, but exhibitive ſigne, an objective, exciting the minde as the word doth in a morall way, repreſenting Chriſt and him crucified; beſides it hath a conſideration of <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>tantum,</hi> it is a ſeal, and not a teaching and repreſenting ſigne onely.

                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the long omiſſion is a barre to a Chriſtians aſſurance: for this Sacrament is added to this very end to aſſure us of the love of God in Chriſt; as the word is a ſpeaking Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſo the Sacrament is a viſible word, whereby we have an aſſurance of Gods favour. It is a ſigne to ſignifie and repreſent a ſeal, to ratifie and confirm; the promiſes we read are confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the believing ſoul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, in the Book of his Eternal Counſel, that Book S. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.1, 2. which had 7 ſeals, to ſignifie that it was perfectly ratified.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in his Son our Saviour, for him hath God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſealed, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. The riches of the New Teſtament are confirmed to us by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by Gods privy Seal: his Spirit is called <hi>the Spirit of promiſe,</hi> Epheſ. 1.13.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, God confirmeth his promiſes by this Sacrament, which is his broad Seale to confirm our faith, and ratifie our aſſurance in Chriſt: It doth give and conferre faith, but more ſurely and ſtrongly confirms faith; which confirmation is not by any inherent power in it, but by the holy Spirit working a ſtrong perſwaſion and aſſurance in us, ſealing the bleſſings of the Covenant, which doe chiefly conſiſt of three parts:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>the forgiveneſſe of ſins,</hi> Jer. 33.8. Iſa. 43.25.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>the adoption of ſons,</hi> Jer. 31.31, 32.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>the promiſe of Eternall bleſſedneſſe.</hi> And what greater bleſſings than pardon to poor ſinners, acceptation of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves to be ſons, and to have the promiſe of Everlaſting life? This is the Covenant written by God, to which he hath put to his Seale for our further aſſurance: One Tree of Life ſerved <hi>Adam,</hi> One Rainbow gave aſſurance to <hi>Noah,</hi> but to us behold Two unchangeable Sacraments, two witneſſes whereby we have full aſſurance. Now I conceive that the deferring of this Seale from time to time, which doth confirm our Charter, is a great weakning of our faith, hindrance of our aſſurance, and ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bleſſings of the Covenant of grace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the long Omiſſion is a barre to the communion that ſhould be betwixt Chriſt and Chriſtians one with another, hence it takes its denomination of <hi>communion,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. As faith receives him, ſo by this we are joyned near to him and have ſpiritual fellowſhip with him; by this (he means) that the faithfull which come with due preparation are joyned and united to Chriſt by Faith inſtrumentally, by the Bread ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, and by the Holy Ghoſt ſpiritually made one ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.17. or one ſpiritual body: as the members receive life from the head, and the tree moyſture from the root, ſo the faithful from Chriſt.</p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:168349:39"/>
                     <p>Secondly, this ſeals that communion that Chriſtians have one with another: For we that are many are one bread and one body, becauſe we are all partakers of one head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. It puts us in minde of our unity and concord being one body, and to avoid diſcord and diſſention, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 20. <hi>When ye come together, &amp;c.</hi> This was one end why it was ordained of Chriſt, to be a bond of love, and chain us together, that we break not from God and our Brethren.<note place="margin">Of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Art. 28.</note> The Church of <hi>England</hi> ſaith, that the Supper of the Lord is not onely a ſigne of love that Chriſtians ought to have amongſt themſelves one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. This are we taught by the ſame bread compact of many corns, the ſame wine preſt out of many grapes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. Oh how many great and grievous are our diſtractions! Brother againſt Brother, Father againſt Son, Miniſter againſt Miniſter, People againſt Miniſter; he hath no part in Chriſt that doth not grieve at this. What a ſhame is it that the Sheep of the ſame Shepheard, the Children of the ſame Father, the Servants of the ſame Maſter, the Heirs of the ſame Kingdome, the Gueſts of the ſame Banquet, the Partakers of the ſame Hope, the Members of the ſame Body, the Profeſſours of the ſame Faith, ſhould contend, and ſtrive one againſt another, fighting, quarrelling, hating, envying, and backbiting one of another. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> condemning the abuſes of the Corinthians, exhorts them to tarry one for another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.33. that they would go hand in hand, and lay aſide all difference and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And our Saviour enjoyns Brotherly reconciliation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.24. <hi>When thou bringeſt thy gift, &amp;c.</hi> I appeal to any judicious Chriſtian, whether this fact doth not conduce to the renewing and maintaining of love, and was by our Saviour inſtituted to that very end, and whether the ſeldome uſe of it be not a great cauſe of that generall hatred, rancour, ſpight and envy of one againſt another.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the long Omiſſion of it is a barre to the frequent meditation of the great work of Redemption.<note place="margin">Art. 28.</note> The Church of <hi>England</hi> calls this a Sacrament of our Redemption by Chriſts death. It was Chriſts laſt word to his Diſciples, the words of a dying friend, which ever leaves behinde deep impreſſions, <hi>[Doe this in remembrance of me,]</hi> it was reſerved till the approaching
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168349:39"/>of his death, that we might the better remember him when he was dead: God gives the Rainbow, a token of mercy to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; the firſt born muſt be ſanctified, that ſo the day of the Jewes deliverance out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> might be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred: There muſt be a Golden pot of Manna reſerved for the remembrance of that great mercy in feeding the Jewes with Angels food. When the Lord parted the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> he commanded <hi>Joſhua</hi> to ſet up 12 Stones in memoriall of his mighty and miraculous works, and that when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould aske in time to come what was meant by thoſe ſtones, they ſhould anſwer, that the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. Even ſo the Lord hath left unto his Church the Sacrament of his Supper as a viſible repreſentation of a crucified Chriſt, and hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to continue this holy remembrance of his death and paſſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25, 26. to be kept in memory, and remain to poſterity that they might know the occaſion of it. I deſire that it may be conſidered, whether the long omiſsion of the Lords Supper doth not hinder Chriſtians from a frequent meditation of the great work of Redemption.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the long Omiſsion is a barre to the ſerious and ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our ſins: it is true, we are every day to call to minde our wormwood and our gall, to caſt up our accompts, <hi>Quid feci, quid non feci?</hi> Yet we had need of all helps to this end, and the Sacrament being a lively repreſentation of a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Chriſt, doth bring to our mindes the remembrance of our bitter ſins, that brought to Chriſt ſuch bitterneſſe of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Magna amaritudo peccati quae tantam amaritudinem pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perit,</hi> Great was the bitterneſſe of ſin which brought forth ſo much bitterneſſe of torment. When we behold a crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, we preſently reflect on our ſins as the proper and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſes of Chriſts ſufferings, <hi>Pilate, Herod, Judas,</hi> the Jewes and Gentiles were but inſtruments which our ſins ſet on work. None are more guilty than we whoſe ſinnes are thoſe bloody inſtruments that ſlew the Lord of glory.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the long Omiſsion is a barre to thoſe helps that doe aſſure us of the promiſes, and ſtrengthen our faith.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by this the Lord repreſents his promiſes, as it were, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:168349:40"/>painted in a Table, and ſetteth them forth as in a lively picture before our eyes, that we may not onely hear, but ſee, handle, touch, and taſt, and digeſt them. It is obſerved, that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth more ſeal the promiſes than the Word doth, not for the ſubſtance and matter it ſelf, but for the manner of working, making us after a ſort to handle Chriſt with our hands, and ſee him with our eyes. Though the Word and Sacraments agree as inſtruments, by which the holy Ghoſt uſeth to make us one with Chriſt, and partakers of ſalvation, the working and forcible power of both depending on God alone, and flowing from him as from a fountain; and yet they differ, in that the Word is offered to all, none excluded and debarred from the hearing of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. yet not all to be admitted to this. Again, the Word begins and begets faith, but this is of another nature. We muſt bring Faith with us: the Word affects the eare, but this offers Chriſt to the eyes, and we ſee him crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this Sacrament ſtrengthens faith, it is an effectual means to that very purpoſe, and it is found by experience that Chriſtians in their ſpiritual languiſhings gather ſtrength from this heavenly Manna, being a ſpeciall ſupport, and prop to faith. The Lords Supper is defined by Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi> to be the Sacrament of the nouriſhing and growth of the faithfull in Chriſt. Why ſhould that be denied which Chriſt himſelf hath appointed as an help and means of this growth and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The Lords Supper is to be conſidered under a fourfold notion: 1. As it is a ſpiritual medicine to cure the remainders of our corruptions. 2. As it is a ſpiritual food to ſtrengthen our weak graces. 3. As it is a ſpiritual cordial to comfort our diſtreſſed conſciences. 4. As it is a ſtrong obſignation and forcible engagement to all acts of thankfulneſſe, and obedience in Jeſus Chriſt. I leave it to any experienced Chriſtian to judge, whether their faith hath not been greatly ſtrengthned in the frequent receiving of this bleſſed Sacrament, and in the long forbearance have found much weakneſſe of faith.</p>

If this pretence were a lawfull warrant to abſtain from the Lords Supper for fear of unworthy receiving, or receiving with the unworthy, we might upon the ſame reaſon bid all godlineſſe farewell, inaſmuch as it opens a gap for men to refrain from all the duties of piety.

This diſcipline (ſaith <hi>Bucanus</hi>) hath 3 parts: Increpation, or Common faction, Suſpenſion, and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, which power belongs to the Governors of the Church: For (ſaith the ſame Author) the power of Eccleſiaſticall Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was in their power, which were called the chief Rulers of the Synagogue, who did alſo manage the affairs of particular Churches. Let none imagine my intention (by what hath been ſpoken) is to eradicate Lay-Elderſhip, it is an Herculean labour too difficult for me: my purpoſe is to ſhew that diſcipline be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Governours of the Church, who are to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>ſcandall,</hi> and thoſe I conceive are the Miniſters of the Goſpel. It is fit the Miniſter ſhould have Aſsiſtants, call them
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:168349:45"/>if you pleaſe, Lay-Elders, but a power of Coordination of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.

                     <p>Fourthly, by way of Anſwer to the Objection. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> All that are baptized, inſtructed in the faith of Chriſt, and make publick profeſſion as members of the viſible Church, (wanting neither ripeneſſe of age, nor uſe of reaſon, nor knowledge of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of godlineſſe, nor legally accuſed, and convicted of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall) ſhould be admitted to the Lords Supper; if none of theſe hinder and render them uncapable, they ought not to be denied the benefit of approach to the Table of the Lord.

                     <p>Firſt, Children that know not the nature, uſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and end of the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Madmen and ſuch as want the uſe of reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> all ignorant perſons that doe not diſcern the Lords body, that have not the knowledge of God, of themſelves, and the doctrine of the Sacraments, and other neceſſary points of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, all Atheiſts, Turks, Jews, and Hereticks, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and ſuch as profeſſe not the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, all prophane, ungodly, and malicious wretches, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> all Drunkards, Adulterers, Blaſphemers, Contemners of God, &amp;c. if theſe ſhould be admitted (after they are legally tried and found out to be ſuch, and by authority adjudged) the Church of God would be a ſynagogue of Sathan, the fellowſhip of Saints a ſtye of ſwine, a ſtable of beaſts, a cage of unclean birds. But the queſtion is not whether ſuch ſhould be debarred, but who hath the power of debarring from the Sacrament; for ſeeing the cenſure of the Church it doth not belong to private perſons, it is not in their power to draw out of the cenſures of the Church againſt notorious offenders, but in the Governours of it.</p>
                     <p>But here it may be demanded whether the Miniſter in the want of government may not ſuſpend his own act,<note place="margin">Dem.</note> and hold his hands from giving the Sacrament to one that he knows to be prophane.</p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:168349:46"/>
                     <p>It is thought by moſt he may not for the Reaſons afore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: it is an act that belongs to the Church-Officers, and would introduce a world of tyranny, and few could aſſure themſelves the benefit of Receiving, if the Miniſter had this unlimited power. Others ſee no reaſon but in caſe of neceſſity a Miniſter may ſuſpend his own act of giving it to one (whom of his own knowledge) he knows may be drunk, and the like, and this is not a cenſure, but <hi>Gradus ad cenſuram.</hi> The Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by the light of Nature, would not ſuffer all to approach their Sacrifices, but cried out, That prophane men muſt be packing: ſuch as have a clear fountain of water delivered to them muſt not ſuffer any to trouble and annoy the water, but muſt endeavour to keep them back by powerfull arguments of the danger of unworthy receiving; which for all that, if they dare go on (and there be no government in the Church) then to keep back his hand from reaching that to him which he knows will aggravate their judgments. Every Paſtor is to have a Paſtoral care of any of his flock, and he hath a power of order and juriſdiction, as a Watchman, though not of Church-juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which belongeth to Church-Officers. This is done by the Law of Charity, and not <hi>Ex officio,</hi> by authority. Every man by Divine Law is his Brothers keeper, and muſt not ſuffer ſin to lie on him, which is no more than <hi>Sublevatio miſeriae pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantis,</hi> the ſuccouring of the miſery of a ſinner; or act of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, mercy, and compaſſion: <hi>Eſſe benevolentiam potius quàm ſeveritatem,</hi> Rather clemency than ſeverity; <hi>charitatem potius eſſe quàm poteſtatem,</hi> Rather an act of charity than power: he doth but the part of a friend, <hi>Aut praevenire errori, aut revocare errantem,</hi> Either to prevent a man before he erre, or to call him from erring.</p>
                     <p>But this I leave to the cenſure of my brethren, for to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by me is ſaucy preſumption.</p>
                     <p>From a promiſcuous receiving by wicked and ungodly, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>4</label> there is a great deal of ſcandal or offence given.</p>
                     <p>That which is perfectly good cannot be the occaſion of evil, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> as the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. Indeed, that which ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and of it ſelf cauſeth evil, is evil it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> know notorious ſinners proved to be ſuch ought
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:168349:46"/>not to be admitted in a conſtituted Church where there is a ſetled Government.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> none but the Officers of the Church have power of Church-cenſure.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that in the want of Government a Miniſter ought to uſe all means poſſible for the removing of ſcandall, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the great abuſe of the Lords Supper; and after ſuch means and endeavours he is not to omit it becauſe of ſcandall, and that for theſe Reaſons:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Scandall or offence will enſue the very beſt actions. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſt is fooliſhneſſe to the Gentiles, a ſtumbling block to the Jewes, an offence to both. The Word is the ſavour of life and death, ſo is the Sacrament a poyſon to the unworthy Receiver, a cordiall to the Believer.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there is not any ordinance of God at which ſome will not be offended. Therefore to lay aſide Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces becauſe ſcandall will follow, is a ſtrange concluſion; for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences will be in the Church till the comming of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Scandals are <hi>accepta,</hi> or <hi>data,</hi> taken, or given; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the offence or ſcandal following the Lords Supper is onely taken not given; for a Miniſter diſpenſeth a neceſſary Ordinance of Chriſt, performs a commanded duty which cannot be omitted without ſin, therefore the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper cannot be ſaid to cauſe ſcandal. For ſcandal given is ſome way or other morally irregular, either becauſe evil in it ſelf, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath appearance of evil, and is inductive to ſin either from the intent of the agent, or nature of the action in it ſelfe. But ſo is not the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evil in it ſelf, nor hath the appearance of evil, being an Ordinance of Chriſt. It is <hi>Bonum per ſe,</hi> and the omiſſion of it is onely <hi>bonum per accidens</hi> in the caſe of ſcandal. Now that which is good <hi>per accidens,</hi> cannot ſhut out that which is good <hi>per ſe:</hi> it is a groſſe ignorance that cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt a fault that proceeds <hi>ex natura facti,</hi> and that which proceeds <hi>ex abuſu boni.</hi> The former is <hi>Malum ſimpliciter,</hi> the other is but <hi>Malum per accidens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here it may be objected, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                        </label> that we cannot partake of the Table of the Lord, and of the Table of Devils; therefore we muſt not have fellowſhip with the ungodly.</p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:168349:47"/>
                     <p>This hath been anſwered before; <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                        </label> I ſhall onely give you what Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſaith, The Table of Idols is that Table of Devils and falſe worſhip, kindly in reſpect of the Object, that we muſt ſeparate from; but a ſcandalous perſon at the Lords Supper partaketh of the Table of Devils by accident, in reſpect the perſon being out of Chriſt eateth damnation to himſelf: but it is not <hi>per ſe</hi> and kindly; the Table of Devils to others and therefore I muſt not ſeparate from it. The Supper was to <hi>Judas</hi> the Devils Table, becauſe Sathan entred in him with a ſop to cauſe him to betray the Lord; and Chriſt told before, <hi>one of them</hi> twelve <hi>had a Devil;</hi> and ſo to one of the twelve the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was the Devils Table, yet could not the Diſciples ſeparate therefrom. I deſire to know,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whether the long omiſſion of the Lords Supper be not as great an offence to many godly honeſt Chriſtians, and cauſe of grief, as the adminiſtration of it can poſsibly be a ſcandal?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whether that good that cometh by it is not greater than the offence that is taken by any?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> whether any duty expreſly commanded ought to be forborn for ſcandal-ſake?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> whether the benefit that commeth by it, be not farre greater than any evil that can follow on the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it?</p>
                     <p>The Miniſter in giving it to the wicked and ungodly gives them poyſon, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>5</label> their own damnation.</p>
                     <p>The Miniſter diſpenſeth not poyſon, <label type="milestone">

                        </label> but a neceſſary Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: if it become poyſon it is becauſe of the ignorance, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full corruption, and evil diſpoſition of the Receiver. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter doth but his duty, and therefore having uſed all lawfull means of informing, inſtructing, menacing, and the like, cannot be guilty of giving poyſon.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> here is not <hi>Occaſio data, ſed accepta,</hi> Not an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſinfully given, but ſinfully taken: and the Miniſter ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth free from the guilt hereof.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a Miniſter doth but what his calling obligeth him to; and if the event be not good, the parties contract guilt, and pull down vengeance on themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The power of a Miniſter to adminiſter the Lords Supper is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168349:47"/>called by Divines <hi>Poteſtas ordinis,</hi> or <hi>poteſtas muneris ſpecialis,</hi> it is a Church-power more ſpecial, and is diſtinguiſhed from the power of juriſdiction, which is more general and common: a Miniſter ought to exerciſe and employ for the edification of the Church all the power and authority that he may lawfully exerciſe. I hold the Church, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> full of wheat and chaffe: I better whom I can, whom I cannot I ſuffer. <hi>Fugio paleam, ne hoc ſim; non aream, ne nihil ſim,</hi> I avoid the chaffe leſt I become chaffe; I keep the floore, leſt I become nothing.</p>
                     <p>Presbytery, the government of the Church is wanting, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>6</label> that ſhould put in practiſe ſeverity againſt all ungodly perſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the want of Diſcipline is to be lamented. <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> It was the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Biſhop <hi>Jewell,</hi> All Miniſters have <hi>idem Ministerium, ſed diverſam poteſtatem.</hi> I deny not the neceſsity of Juriſdiction both Corrective and Coactive: the one reſtraining where there is too much forwardneſſe; the other inforcing where there is ſlackneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, all ſcandalous perſons convicted to be ſuch, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Church ought to caſt out; but we are not to caſt our ſelves out of the Church, and debarre our ſelves from the Ordinances of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if Presbytery never be ſetled, as is neither impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> nor impoſsible; ſhall this neceſſary Ordinance be never diſpenſed? God forbid.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Sacrament of the Lords Supper hath been truly adminiſtred without Presbytery, otherwiſe we ſhall ſhew our ſelves the moſt uncharitable people that ever breathed, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the preceding Church for many generations, and throw dirt in their faces that ſuffered Martyrdome for maintaining the truth, and purity of this Ordinance: I ſhall onely inſtance the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper by our Saviour, which was moſt exact and perfect in the point of Eſſentials, and a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for the Church, for after-times; it wanted nothing Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially belonging to the true diſpenſation of it: inſomuch that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſticks cloſe unto that pattern, and telleth the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, <hi>What I have received, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Now at that time (I think none will affirm) that the Church was presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and that there were Lay Elders amongſt the Apoſtles:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168349:48"/>or that it appeareth out of <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. &amp; 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. That thoſe that received the Lords Supper were all examined by an Elderſhip,<note place="margin">Ieanes.</note> otherwiſe no admittance; the Lords Supper hath no eſſential dependance on an Elderſhip, as that it cannot be without it. It is no ſuch neceſſary antecedent as that the Lords Supper is to be omitted or forborn for the want of it; for if Presbytery never be eſtabliſhed, ſhall the Lords Supper never be adminiſtred? God forbid. The exerciſe of Diſcipline as I ſaid before, is not neceſſary for the eſſence of a viſible Church, but onely neceſſary to the welbeing of a Church. But now, all doe ſay, That the Sacraments are, though not abſolutely, yet in ſome degrees neceſſary to the eſſence &amp; beeing of a Church. So then, if you compare together theſe two duties, Excluſion of ſcandalous and ignorant perſons from the Lords Supper, and the Celebration of the Lords Supper; the Obligation unto the Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, is of the two, the greater and more weighty. For the Lords Supper is more the worſhip of God, leſſe ſeparable from, and more neceſſary to the Church than excluſion of ſcandalous and groſly ignorant perſons from the Lords Supper. Therefore it is altogether improbable that this latter, <hi>viz: excluſion,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould be an Antecedent abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary unto the former, <hi>viz: the celebration of the Lords Supper.</hi> That the Paſſeover and Circumciſion were omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe is moſt true, yet that makes nothing to this purpoſe. For after the firſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Paſſeover all future celebrations were by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and plain command to be in the Land of <hi>Canaan, Exod.</hi> 13.4, 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. from the 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> to the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, therefore this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concludeth nothing.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>OF the firſt, <hi>Perfecting of the Saints,</hi> where let us conſider what is meant by <hi>Saints,</hi> and what by <hi>Perfection. Saint</hi> the Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and cometh from a privitive <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>terra,</hi> denoting that <hi>holy men</hi> ſhould be <hi>unearthly, holineſſe</hi> is in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>earthlineſs.</hi> Oh how few are the number of Saints in theſe dayes that grovel altogether on the Earth! GOD is in their Mouth, the World in their Hearts, like the fooliſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median, they cry <hi>O Coelum!</hi> and point the finger downward. Oh how is this pretious name abuſed, and by many aſſumed, as the Devil <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle, to deceive, driving on their own ends and intereſts, and riſing to honour and preferment by the ſtaires of pretended Saintſhip. As Religion is the beſt thing, ſo the Corruption of it the worſt. <hi>Corruptio optimi eſt peſſima,</hi> and the greateſt villany and michief hath marched under the flagge of Religion, Either intended by the ſeduced, or pretended by Hypocrites, their own hypocriſie deludes them, ſo that they grow amorous of their ſeeming virtues: if they can appear good, there is little care taken how to be good, as if all Religion conſiſted in appearance, whereas it ſhould be from God: the coal of our zeal ſhould be fetcht from heaven, for God and the furtherance of his glory, not our own ends and intereſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. according to God both for the quality of the matter, and quantity of the intention of affection, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. <hi>It is good alwaies,</hi> there is the quality of the matter; <hi>to be zealous in a good thing,</hi> there is the quantity of the intention of the affection. But to come to the word <hi>Saints,</hi> it admits of a double ſignification, either by External profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Internal regeneration. The firſt is known to us, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God, for the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, and the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168349:49"/>Lord onely knows who are his; the one are his in the judgment of charity, the other in the judgment of infallibility. People outwardly profeſſing Religion and manifeſting to the world lives conformable, may be called Saints. So was the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. The Church of <hi>Philippi, Phil.</hi> 1.1. and yet there were many Hypocrites amongſt them; in this ſenſe men may be Saints and yet damned; profeſſe Religion, ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, and yet want the power of godlineſſe and ſincerity. Many doe wofully delude themſelves with the name when they are nothing in truth and reality; but alas! when theſe are to die, and death ſtares them in the faces, how ſad will be their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; it is not an empty name will ſerve the turn, there muſt be more to the attainment of heaven.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> what is meant by <hi>Perfection,</hi> or <hi>Perfecting:</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is a ſtate not to be obtained on Earth, but reſerved for Heaven. <hi>Talis ſedes expectat talem Seſſorem,</hi> Such a houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſuch an Inhabitant: as long as we carry fleſh about us ſin we will, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Non plenam induimus perfectionem donec totam exu mus infectionem.</hi> All the ſtains of our infection muſt be waſhed away before there can be perfection. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Auguct. Hieron. tom. <hi>2.</hi> fol. <hi>254.</hi>
                        </note> 3.12. <hi>Not that I had already attained, &amp;c.</hi> It is true, we are ſaid to be perfect here, <hi>perfectione partium, ſed non perfectione graduum;</hi> partially, but not gradually: though every part be in ſome meaſure ſanctified; yet we muſt grow to a perfect man: we are <hi>Mundi &amp; mundani,</hi> Clean in part, and in part to be made clean; all our perfection conſiſts in the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our imperfection. All our righteouſneſſe in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſins,<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. <hi>19.</hi> &amp; <hi>17.</hi> Chap. de Civit. Dei.</note> rather than in the perfection of virtue. The Authour to the Hebrews tells us of <hi>our comming to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, Heb.</hi> 12.23. This is a paſſive quality: <hi>Non qui perficiunt, ſed qui perficiuntur;</hi> Not ſuch as have made themſelves perfect, but are made perfect. Our purity is not <hi>in facto,</hi> but <hi>in fieri;</hi> inchoate, not finiſhed. The wicked are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectè imperfecti,</hi> perfectly imperfect. The godly are <hi>imperfectè perfecti,</hi> imperfectly perfect. The <hi>Cathari</hi> againſt whom <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> write in their Books of Hereſies, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that they were without ſin; and the Novatians and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts held, that they were ſo holy that they needed not ſay,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168349:49"/>
                        <hi>Forgive us our trespaſſes. Audes tu Novatiane mundum te di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere? etſi operibus mundus eſſes, hoc ſolo verbo immundus fieres,</hi> Dareſt thou call thy ſelf clean, though thou ſhouldeſt be ſo in regard of thy works? yet this one word (to ſay thou art clean) is enough to make thee unclean. <hi>Quis melior Prophaeta Davide,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard, de quo dixit Deus, &amp;c.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bern. in annot.</note> Who is better than <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> of whom the Lord ſaid, <hi>I have found a man after my own heart?</hi> yet he had need to ſay, <hi>Lord enter not into judgment with thy ſervant, &amp;c. Non peccare Dei juſtitia eſt; hominis juſtitia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgentia Dei,</hi> To be without ſin is the righteouſneſſe of God; mans righteouſneſſe is Gods indulgence pardoning of ſinne. Theſe kinde of men thus ſwelled with pride, blown with oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and dreaming of ſelf perfection, are in a moſt dangerous condition. Let the Donatiſt drink never ſo deep of the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. Cup of his own Righteouſneſs. Let the Pelagian as deeply pledge him. Let the Papiſt climb upon his Meritorious ſtairs. Let the Phariſee glory in his own Robes. Let the Legalliſt pride himſelf in his own acquired Holineſs: yet all theſe will be found to ſaile on dangerous ſhelves. But not to make this altogether our diſcourſe, the words are read diverſly:<note place="margin">Galvin. Castalian.</note> Some reade <hi>ad conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionem,</hi> or <hi>ad Condendos Sanctos,</hi> The Saints are of Gods houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and the Church is Gods Houſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6.

We ſin daily and hourly, and therefore that we may not fall finally from grace, we had need be repaired, and under propt by the daily exhortations of Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, leſt our building fall.</p>
                     <p>Others read it, <hi>ad coagmentationem Sanctorum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aretius. Beza. Zanchy.</note> for the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and joynting of the Saints. The beſt of people are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times out of joynt, out of order, out of ſquare. Now the Lord out of his infinite goodneſſe gives ſome Apoſtles &amp;c. for the joyning and knitting of the Saints unto the head Chriſt by faith, and unto one another by love.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it is read, as moſt agreeable to the Syriack, and vulgar Latine, for <hi>the perfecting of the Saints;</hi> and that in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in regard of their daily growth in grace, going from
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168349:50"/>ſtrength to ſtrength, for the word of God is profitable for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in regard that their number is fully accompliſhed by the preaching of the Goſpel; for grace is not onely begun, but perfected by this means. Here, take notice, that Goſpel-Miniſters are not onely for converſion of Sinners, but confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Saints.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that the Saints are not above Goſpel-Ordinances. The Word of God is the Scepter of Chriſt by which he rules and governs, called <hi>the Rod of his power,</hi> Pſal. 110.2. <hi>The Law of Sion,</hi> Iſa. 2.3. <hi>The wiſdome of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.7. <hi>and the ſword of his Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 6.17. Now he is ſtubborn, that will not be perſwaded by his Rod: Rebellious, that will not be guided by his Law; Fooliſh that will not ſubmit to his wiſdome; and mad, that will deſpiſe the ſword of his Spirit: they are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in a mighty errour that ſay, <hi>they are above the Ordinances of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One end of the Miniſteriall Office, is, <hi>the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or perfecting of the Saints.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> writes <hi>to the Elect of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.1. <hi>and to thoſe that had obtained like pretious faith.</hi> Gods Elect have need to be put in minde of their duty; even thoſe that are <hi>regenerate</hi> and <hi>ſanctified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond end of the Miniſterial Office, is, <hi>the work of the Miniſtery;</hi> the word <hi>[Worke]</hi> forbids Loytering, and the word <hi>[Miniſtery]</hi> Lording. <hi>Domabis Lupos, ſed non dominaberis ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> told <hi>Eugenius.</hi>

                        </note> As the firſt concerneth ſuch as <hi>are called,</hi> ſo this concerneth ſuch as are <hi>to call:</hi> the <hi>gifts</hi> of Chriſt are not <hi>theorical,</hi> but <hi>practical,</hi> and <hi>given</hi> unto Paſtors for the work of the Miniſtery, to labour faithfully and painfully to bring ſouls to God. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves,</hi> (ſaith the holy Choſt) <hi>and to all the flock whereof the &amp;c.</hi> Acts 20. The end of our preaching is not to make way for our ſelves, and our own preferment, but for Gods glory; <hi>to prepare the way of the Lord, and make ſtraight paths for our God,</hi> Iſa. 40.3, 4. We have a hard task, <hi>Ars artium, Regimen animarum;</hi> The cunning of all cunnings is, to govern ſouls. It is no eaſie work to make men righteous, to diſpoſſeſſe them of open impiety, and cloſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; to take the pillows from under their arms, to ſtrip them
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168349:50"/>naked and bare, to ſhew their own emptineſſe and nothingneſs. Oh! how many are there that preach Faction, not Religion; that cry up <hi>Michaël,</hi> not <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that ſtudy State-affairs, not Goſpel; that catch at popular applauſe, and rather hunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into fame, than ſouls into Heaven, <hi>Se praedicantes, non Chriſtum,</hi> Preaching themſelves, not Jeſus Chriſt. Divinity by too many is made a ſhift; to dig. they are too lazie; to beg, aſhamed; and therefore ſhark a living out of the Church. This is not the end why God hath placed theſe Officers in the Church, but to be faithful and powerfull in the diſcharge of their duty. The onely thing that ſhould be deſired by a Paſtor, is, the weal and benefit of his flock; for if the mark whereat we look be but to make our commodity by the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, wherein doe we differ from thieves and robbers? This is that whereof the Lord complains ſo grievouſly by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>The Prieſts teach for hire, the Prophets propheſie for money: yet will they leane upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us?</hi> And again, theſe ſhepheards cannot underſtand: they all look to their own way, every one for his advantage, and for his own purpoſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> bleſſing <hi>Levi</hi> before his death, ſaith firſt, <hi>They ſhall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Iſrael thy Law; they ſhall put incenſe before thy faece:</hi> and then addeth, <hi>Bleſſe, O Lord, his ſubſtance, accept the work of his hands.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, So long as <hi>Levi</hi> and his Sons doe not ſeek their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, but thy glory; thou art righteous, and canſt not forget to provide in large manner, both for them and theirs.</p>
                     <p>A third end is, <hi>the edifying of the body of Chriſt:</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this concerns ſuch as are to be called and converted. The gifts of the Spirit are given to every man to edifie withall, 1 Cor. 12.7. <hi>Poſiti eſtis dispenſatores, ſed in aedificationem, non in deſtructionem: aliter non fidelis dispenſatio, ſed crudelis diſſipatio,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard:</hi> Ye are placed for edification, and not the deſtruction of any; It is true, the word proveth the ſavour of death to death, but that is accidentally, and not the proper work of it: whileſt we ſeek to win your ſoules to God, give us the hearing: otherwiſe it is not poſſible our doctrine ſhould tend to edification. Chriſt delivers to the people a parable of the Sower, and of the ſeed; <hi>Some fell by the way ſide, and it was troden down; ſome fell upon
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168349:51"/>a rock, and aſſoon as it was ſprung up it withered away:</hi> And ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 8. beginning at the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, this Chriſt uttereth for their edification: but obſerve the latter part of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>When he had ſaid theſe things, he cryed, He that hath eares to hear, let him hear:</hi> he cryed, not onely to manifeſt his affection, but our dulneſſe; he is not ſaid to cry above four or five times in all his life. He cryed as he taught in the Temple, <hi>John</hi> 7.38. He cryed when he raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, <hi>John</hi> 11.43. He cryed, <hi>John</hi> 12.44. He cryed on the Croſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. at which time he delivered matter of great conſequence: So here, this expreſsion being upon a cry, muſt not lightly be reſpected of us. Men have 2 Feet, but ſcarcely one to walke in the way of God; 2 Eyes, but ſcarcely one to ſee the things of God. 2 Hands, but ſcarcely one to work in his Vineyard. 2 Ears, but ſcarcely one to hear the word of God: <hi>A good ear</hi> (ſaith the Wiſeman) <hi>will hearken unto wiſdome;</hi> whence obſerve two things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that we <hi>hearken</hi> unto nothing but that which is good, <hi>unto wiſdome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that we hearken unto it gladly, with a great deſire to learn; for in Scripture phraſe <hi>obaudire,</hi> is <hi>obedire:</hi> So Chriſt in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me;</hi> that is, He that obeyeth you, obeyeth me; and, <hi>He that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you, despiſeth me.</hi> If we would make our Election ſure, we muſt not begin <hi>à priori,</hi> but <hi>à poſteriori;</hi> ſuch as with a good heart hear the Word of God and keep it, and bring forth fruit, ſhall inherit the kingdome of God: but it ſhall be taken away and be of no benefit to thoſe that are careleſſe and fruitleſſe. Now that you may edifie and profit, hear Gods word, frequent the publick Ordinances, wait at the gates of wiſdomes houſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34, 35. Lay your Noſes open to the ſweet ſavour of Life, your Eyes unto the Day ſtarre that is ſprung from on high, and your Ears unto the voice of the wiſe Charmer. Doe not as ſome, deſire to know that they may onely know, which is curioſity; or that they might be known, which is vanity; but ro edifie and better your ſelves, which is true wiſdome. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatis ut ſciatis,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi>) <hi>ſciatis ut aedificemini, &amp; hoc in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritas eſt; ut aedificetis, &amp; hoc charitas eſt;</hi> Hear to know; know to edifie your ſelves; this is integrity: to edifie others; this is charity.</p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:168349:51"/>
                     <p>Secondly, that thou mayeſt edifie, pray fervently, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the Lord would ſhew thee his waies, and teach thee his paths. <hi>If any man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>lack wiſdome,</hi> Jam. 1.5. <hi>let him aske, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Read much, and meditate the ſacred Scriptures; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as the affections are moſt moved by hearing, ſo the judgment is beſt informed by reading. Reade, meditate, pray, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate; reading enquireth, meditation findeth, prayer reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, and contemplation taſteth.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that thou mayeſt edifie, lay aſide prejudice, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and malice, guile, envy, and heare the word as a new-born babe; the ſmell poſſeſt with Rue cannot ſent the Roſe: the taſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with gall imagineth all morſels bitter. It is a Rule in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, Nothing receives any thing but which is empty of all other things of a contrary nature: the Eare muſt be empty of all ſounds, the Taſt of all ſavours, the Eye of all colours, before there can be entertainment given to a new object; certainly he hath a moſt wicked heart that dares come into Gods preſence, and carp at his Word, that cometh with an intention to lye at catch: <hi>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>to the houſe of God, and be more ready &amp;c.</hi> Eccleſ. 5.1. By <hi>feet</hi> he means the <hi>affections;</hi> there is <hi>Oris cuſtodia,</hi> Prov. 13.3. The mouth wants keeping. <hi>David</hi> prayes God, Pſal. 141. <hi>to ſet a watch before it.</hi> There is <hi>Cordis cuſtodia,</hi> Prov. 4.23. the heart needs keeping too. There is <hi>Manuum custodia,</hi> Eſa. 56.2. The hands doe often what they ſhould not. All the parts of the body, yea, the powers of the ſoul, are in the phraſe of Scripture meant by the feet; yea all our actions.</p>
                     <p>Take notice that that which cures thee doth not alwaies pleaſe thee: thou nauſeateſt that Phyſick that would doe thee moſt good; doe not ſequeſter thy Paſtor, becauſe he would ſequeſter thee from thy hypocriſie; doe not thruſt him out of his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, becauſe he bringeth thee ſowre grapes, and ſharp wine of reproofs; doe not caſt upon him falſe imputations, becauſe thou art fretted with juſt reprehenſions: conſider whoſe Word he ſpeaks, whoſe meſſage he carrieth, and why God ſendeth him: For, if you receive not the meſſage and Meſſenger, that bringeth the glad tydings, it is an argument of a hard and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:168349:52"/>ſtubborn heart; yea, I dare lay this down as a poſitive truth, That no childe of God cometh into Gods preſence to hear his Word, but with godly reverence, due preparation, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full attention, he leaves prejudice behinde, and puts on <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> reſolution, <hi>Acts</hi> 10 33.</p>

                     <p>WHat hath been ſpoken, extremely condemneth the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of thoſe that durſt be ſo bold and preſumptuous as to take upon them the <hi>Miniſterial Function,</hi> or exerciſe any part of it without lawful Ordination or deputation thereunto: Of this, ſome I finde guilty, as Maſter <hi>John Butler</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Stowe,</hi> who took upon him a publick charge of Souls at <hi>Lich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> the boldneſſe to Marry, and to Baptize Infants, had the maintenance of 150 lib. <hi>per annum</hi> allowed him upon a falſe Certificate that <hi>he was a Miniſter of the Gospel,</hi> and yet was not ſet apart to this holy Function.

                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this diſtinction proceeds from the puddle of Popery, where I finde, ſomething of intention, but not much to your purpoſe, (yet I believe there you rak'd for it.)

When the Biſhop and others were come to ſee this ſight, the Prieſt findes out that deceit, and ſaid, <hi>I baptize thee in the Biſhops name, my own, and in the name of the Godfathers.</hi> The Biſhop breaks out into theſe words, <hi>Is this the form of baptizing Infants?</hi> The Prieſt anſwers, <hi>As is the Childe, ſuch is the Baptiſme.</hi> Here was an antique Childe, and as merry a Baptiſme.

What a ſtrange Riddle is here, that thoſe that are Orthodox, ſhould allow and approve of what is Heterodox? But that is not the title, <hi>Reverend</hi> they muſt be, a good word, but foully abuſed.

                     <p>The Romiſh Church (it is obſerved) have canonized many for Saints, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> who were no better than Devils Styles of <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Orthodox</hi> is not ſufficient: that they were ſuch, we muſt take Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his friends words for it.

                     <p>Other Reverend Divines, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> implies Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> one, ſuch ſurely as he was when he came to <hi>Lichfield.</hi> There is a ſort of people whoſe <hi>Entia</hi> be <hi>tranſcendentia,</hi> in all things abſolute Superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:168349:59"/>you take heed, that you doe not welcome Religion under a wrong notion; there is an Idol called <hi>Self,</hi> ſet up in every corner, and men fall down &amp; worſhip it; this is <hi>Englands</hi> great abomination, men thinking themſelves ſomething when they are nothing, miſtaking the means of grace and holineſſe; for grace and holineſſe it ſelf, formality and meer outſideneſſe in Religion are thoſe things which breed ſo many miſcarriages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. Here in effect thou haſt <hi>beſtiam Pharmacopolae</hi> that <hi>Julian</hi> the Pelagian upbraided S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> with, the Beaſt that the Apothecary promiſed his Patient of wonderful virtue, which afore morning was come, had eaten up her ſelf.

                     <p>Religion is the Jewell of the Ring, and conſiſteth of two parts; Faith, and Works: the latter demonſtrates the former. You know S. <hi>James</hi> his rule, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy Works.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, it is a notable hypocriſie to boaſt of Religion.

Every man (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) hath a Pope bred in him, an opinion of his own works; albeit there be in him no reall vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and true ſubſtance: as wickedneſs, ſo this devil of conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the ruine of thouſands: a ſpeckled Phariſee is all one to God, as a ſpotted Publican: he diſlikes the hot feaver and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of hypocrifie, aſwell as the cold palſie, and ſhaking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of impiety: there is a Generation of men that are ſo proud of their worth, and puffed up with vain conceit, that when the rod of God is ſhaken over the heads of a Nation, they make themſelves the onely men that are fit to ſtand in the gap: They blaze the honour of their Miniſters preaching to be ſo full of life, that they, and onely they know the marrow of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: and as for their Prayers, they think them ſo effectual, as if <hi>Elias</hi> Spirit were redoubled on them, and every one of them a ſecond <hi>Eliſha.</hi> What others in charity may give, is not modeſt in you to aſſume to your ſelves, <hi>Prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I have known the time (you may bleſſe the liberty of this (for ſuch as you reap benefit of it) that ſuch an action would not have paſſed unpuniſhed. I ſhall conclude this with an expreſſion of Mr. <hi>Butlers</hi> to Mr. <hi>Crafton, That at that time he came to</hi> Lichfield <hi>there was no Ordination in</hi> London. I bluſh and admire at your frivolous excuſes and groundleſſe aſſertions: was there no Ordination in <hi>London</hi> fron <hi>June</hi> 1651, at which time you were motioned to <hi>Lichfield</hi> till <hi>May</hi> following 1652. Had you been as carefull to have been ordained, as you were covetous of means, you might not have wanted Ordination. The Committee for the Univerſities, and the Truſtees and Committee for plundred Miniſters had your name given them as a Miniſter, and a Certificate to that purpoſe; for, they never ſetled any in any place but ſuch of whom they received teſtimony that they were Miniſters of the Goſpel. I wonder by whoſe means and ſollicitations thoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies and Certificates were procured, who was guilty of theſe deliberate untruths; did the Miniſter ſubſcribe ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? the ſin of misinformation was yours; if knowingly, then both equally guilty: how can you free your ſelf from aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and jugling in this kinde? Upon theſe Certificates you were aſſigned to a publick Charge, and had the allowance of 150 li. <hi>per annum,</hi> preached, baptized, and married. Are theſe light and ſleight things? have you not cauſ to be humbled, and lay aſide your vain and frivolous excuſes; to cozen your brethren, to delude a Committee?

You have abundantly manifeſted this, not onely by your Schiſme, which hath cauſed a wide breach in a peaceable City, though I uſed all poſſible means to prevent it; being truly ſenſible of thoſe ſad effects and conſequences that enſue upon the diviſion of Miniſters, that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:168349:61"/>nothing would content you but a diſtinct Charge contrary to the order of ſettlement which enjoyned a joynt charge of the City and Pariſhes thereunto belonging, had we continued as one, would have been a ſtrong motive to have perſwaded the City to follow our example; but you muſt needs row to the North, and leave me alone in the South. At your firſt coming to <hi>Stowe</hi> you owned the people as your flock; you had not been there above two moneths, but your friends ſent to a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Councel of State (doubtleſſe not unknown to you) to bring you to that place and people you had before denied; you have now your longed expectation, though to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable trouble. And let the City judge whether I ever in the leaſt troubled or diſquieted you in your place. I ſhall paſſe by your ſcornfull language to Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> in which you diſcovered a great deal of pride and malice. I am conſtrained to adde one thing, and were there nothing elſe, that beſpeaks you moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, that you had privately a hand in my bitter perſecution, for the accompliſhing of your ſlf-ends. You have not been good neither <hi>in greſſu,</hi> or <hi>progreſſu,</hi> and therefore a miracle if good <hi>n egreſſu.</hi> All is well, ſo long as you fare well and rule the roſt; you took a politick courſe how to be aſſured to feed your ſelf, before you fed your flock; and to have maintenance, before you were a Miniſter: what a prepoſterous thing is this, neither lawfull by Mans or GODS Laws, that ſuch ſhould have Church-means that were not Church-men, or ſet apart to the Miniſtery? I reade, that when the good Prophet wept upon <hi>Hazael,</hi> he asked, <hi>Why weepeth my Lord?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>Becauſe I know the evil that thou wilt doe to the Children of Iſrael. Their ſtrong holds wilt thou ſet on fire, ſlay their young men with the ſword, daſh their Children againſt the ſtones, and rip up their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Childe.</hi> He replied, <hi>What, is thy ſervant a dog, that I ſhould doe this great thing?</hi> What I obſerve is this, that he thought it impoſſible, that the Devil ſhould ever work him to ſo horrid a miſchief; yet by degrees, he was wrought to this ſelf-incredited miſchief, as impoſsible as at the firſt he judged it, at laſt he performed it. It is juſtly to be feared, now you are arrived to the pitch of your deſires, you will involve the poor City in much confuſion, and diſorder; for, Schiſmaticks are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:168349:62"/>men of unquiet and turbulent ſpirits, and your actions beſpeak you a proud, ſeditious, and ſelf-ended Man: and now forſooth you are got to be a Commiſsioner for ejecting of ſcandalous Miniſters: it is a brave world, when vice rebuks ſin; hopes of a glorious Reformation. I appeal to any who have read the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Fathers, and others, upon that text of CHRIST, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15. whether your practice ſuites not with the character of thoſe Wolves our Saviour ſpeaks of. You that have made no conſcience at the great ſin of <hi>intruſion,</hi> will ſcarcely boggle at any. I have read a ſtory (with it I conclude) out of Sir <hi>Richard Barkley,</hi> of a Reverend and Religious Archbp. of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who (being a long time depraved, and in fine deprived of his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and office by two corrupt Cardinals, his Judges, and a falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Advocate his familiar friend) out of the bitterneſſe of his ſpirit, made his appeal from them unto the Lord of Heaven. God knoweth (unto whom all things are naked) that I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly condemned; yet I will not appeal here from your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; for that I know ye ſhall ſoonr be believeed in your ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than I am in ſpeaking the truth; and therefore I receive this heavy cenſure for the rebellions of my youth, and other ſins: nevertheleſſe, I appeal from your judgment, to the Judge Eternall, and onely wiſe, which is CHRIST JESUS, before whom I ſummon you. The Cardinals fell into a laughing, and ſaid, That <hi>if he would goe before, they would follow.</hi> It hapned that within a year and half, the poor Biſhop died; the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals did not long ſurvive; the one was ſlain, the other eat off his own hands and died mad. And laſtly, the <hi>Judas</hi> of all (I mean his falſe friend placed in his room) was mortally hated of all men, for his ſedition and cruelty, and afterwards came to an untimely end. Such as take delight in perſecution, eſpecially of Miniſters, hale judgments one their own heads; which I pray God divert. I beſeech you conſider, ſin is habituated by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and hardned by impenitency; if you cannot ſtay your ſelf from going in ſin, ſtay your ſelf from going on; if you will break out, timely break off by repentance. Let God be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in an humble acknowledgment. It is the voice of a friend, <hi>Aut praevenire errori, aut revocare errantem;</hi> Either to prevent a man before he erreth, or to recall him erring. When mens
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:168349:62"/>wits, and the Devils to help, have found out the faireſt pretexts for ſin, Gods juſtice ſtrikes off all, and leaves ſin naked and puniſhable. Many pretences have been found out for many ſins, beſides diſtinctions, mitigations, qualifications, extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, colours, queſtions, neceſsities, inconveniences, tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ignorances, &amp;c. But when man hath done, God begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; one argument of Gods now, is ſtronger than all ours. Thou ſhalt not doe this. Conſider the examples of <hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>FOr the continuance of the Miniſterial Office, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it is not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary but laſting, and muſt remain unto the end of the world,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.13.</note> 
                        <hi>[untill we all come to the unity of the faith, and of &amp;c.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Unity, in the Text, hath a double relation:
<list>
                           <item>1. To Faith.</item>
                           <item>2. To Knowledge.</item>
                        </list> And the object of both is Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Faith is taken paſſively,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Adams,</hi> The Saints meeting.</note> or actively; either for that whereby a man believeth, or for that which a man believeth; either for the inſtrument that apprehendeth, or for the object that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. Now if we take it for the form, there is an Unity of Faith, <hi>Ratione objecti, non ratione ſubjecti,</hi> One in reſpect of the object on which it reſts; not one, in reſpect of the ſubject in which it remaineth; every man hath his proper faith, and every faith hath Chriſt for its object: he that ſeeth, muſt ſee with his own eyes; he that feeleth, muſt feel with his own hands; he that entreth into the manſion of glory, muſt have oyle ready in his own lamp; the juſt ſhall live by his own faith, and we ſhall all meet in the unity of one holy Catholick faith. Now if we take it in the other ſenſe for Chriſt, in whom we have believed, we ſhall meet undoubtedly in the unity of thoſe joyes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which we have long expected; and all Believers ſince the Creation till the worlds Diſſolution ſhall meet in the unity of faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there ſhall be Unity of Knowledge at the laſt day, though the manner of knowing ceaſeth, yet the matter remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; all our knowledge in this life is through the ſpectacles of faith, in the glaſſe of the Scriptures; we ſee in part, we know imperfectly, we behold Chriſt through the latteſſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.9. darkly through a glaſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. but in heaven we ſhall
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:168349:73"/>know him face to face; we ſhall live by ſight, not by faith: faith and hope ſhall vaniſh, there ſhall be onely fruition in heaven; and in this we ſhall all meet, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2.</p>
                     <p>To a perfect man; full perfection is reſerved for heaven, when our reunited bodies and ſoules ſhall poſſeſſe perfect glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and reign with our Saviour for ever. We are ſaid here to be one body whoſe head is Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. but there, one perfect man; and in truth the expreſſion is very patheticall, for the Saints in glory cannot be called a body, for a body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives augmentation, encreaſe, and growth; ſo this myſticall body encreaſeth with the encreaſe of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. Now in heaven there is no augmentation, encreaſe, and growth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the Saints compared to a perfect man.</p>
                     <p>To the meaſure of the Stature; not that all in heaven ſhall be of that age wherein Chriſt died, onely it denotes that there ſhall be nothing wanting to make our glory perfect; here we ſhoot out ſome few boughs, bring forth ſome little fruit, we grow as faſt as we can, adding to faith, virtue; to virtue, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but there we ſhall have a full meaſure of ſanctity, of comfort, of bliſſe, of glory, of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Chriſts fulneſſe is to be conſidered perſonally, or myſtically; perſonally in himſelf, and ſo he is not onely perfect, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. in him dwelleth not onely a ſufficient fulneſs, but all the fulneſs; not of any created nature, but of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; not phantaſtically, but bodily.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is to be conſidered myſtically, or in relation to his Church, who ſhall be gathered together to the head, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the fulneſſe of Chriſt. The words thus explained, there ariſeth from hence this truth:</p>
                     <p>That the office and function of the Miniſtery is not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> but perpetuall, that is, muſt remain till the Saints be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in glory, it muſt continue till we all meet, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>God was the firſt Teacher and Doctour of the world, as he was in himſelfe, ſo in his teaching wonderfull; in proceſſe of time this Divine wiſdome thought it neceſſary to uſe outward inſtruments, and to teach the ſons of men, by Men; yet through various diſpenſations, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.1. God can give ſpirituall life without the ordinary means; he can maintain a naturall life
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168349:74"/>without bread, he can give wiſdome without a Teacher, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him is impoſsible, but what is to us naturall, ſin, and defects: though God can doe all things by his abſolute power, yet it is his will to ordain his Word as the ordinary means of ſalvation, to give men knowledge by inſtruction, and ſave by teaching. Thus <hi>Cornelius</hi> was taught by <hi>Peter, Lydia</hi> by <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> by <hi>Ananias,</hi> the Eunuch by <hi>Philip,</hi> Every Soul that is wiſe in the Doctrine of Salvation by Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangelifts, Paſtors, and Feachers appointed for the gathering together of the Saints for the work, &amp;c. When the Lord intended a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his people, he made them this promiſe, <hi>I will give you Paſtors according to my heaert, that ſhall feed you with knowledge and underſtanding.</hi> Now the Lord hath not at any time ceaſed, and left off, but from the infancy of the world to this preſent hour hath continued the Miniſtery to his Church; Chriſt gives his Apoſtles a Commiſsion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all Nations;</hi> and concludes with a promiſe, verſe 20. <hi>Loe I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, &amp;c.</hi> God will ſend ſhepherds till every loſt ſheep be brought to his fold; the Miniſters voice ſhall ſound, till the Archangels voice be heard.<note place="margin">Art. 23. Pro. 4.</note> This is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And the late Aſſembly of Divines hath this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion, Unto the Catholick viſible Church,<note place="margin">chap. 25.3.</note> Chriſt hath given the Miniſters, Oracles and Ordinances of God, for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perfecting of the Saints in this life to the end of the world. You reade the Miniſtration of the Law had an end, but the Miniſtration of the Goſpel hath no end, till the world end; <hi>God hath made us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the spirit; the letter killeth, but the ſpirit giveth life,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. The proper office of the Law is to terrifie, to condemn; but the power of the Goſpel is to convert, to ſave. <hi>Moſes</hi> glory is done away, the type is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; but Chriſts glory remains, and abides for ever: after the firſt Teſtament, there did follow a ſecond; but after the ſecond, there ſhall ſucceed none: the Goſpel in the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. is called, <hi>the everlaſting Gospel.</hi> The Miniſtery of the Goſpel (ſaith <hi>Zanchy</hi>) begun with Chriſt, and ſhall end with the world; but the power of it is everlaſting, <hi>A condito orbe uſque in omnem aeternitatem duratura,</hi> for it is the power of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:168349:74"/>God unto ſalvation unto every one that believeth: not onely is it called ſo in regard of the power of it; but that everlaſting life is the ſubject of it: it holds forth eternall life, and is the common ordinary means of bringing us thither; as the blood of Chriſt muſt be for the ſaving of ſinners to the end of the world, ſo his Goſpel muſt be preached that the people may be taught how this blood muſt be applied.</p>
                     <p>As long as there is a Church upon earth which will be to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon &amp;c.</hi> God can aſſoon forget himſelfe, as his promiſe; ceaſe to be God, as ceaſe to be faithfull: As long, I ſay, as there is a Church on Earth, ſo long muſt there be Teachers in and for the edifying of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 28. and ſo here <hi>he hath given ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets &amp;c.</hi> Experience telleth us, there are Wolves as full of craft as cruelty, who deſiring to devour their flock, endeavour the removall of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, but <hi>Pan curat oves oviúmque magiſtros.</hi> Our great Shepherd preſerveth his ſheep and ſhepherds. He that hath given the Miniſtery to his Church, will (maugre the malice of all oppoſition) maintain that order in it, and keep faſt thoſe ſtars in his right hand, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.16. that none can pluck them thence; it is true, the great red Dragon with his tayle, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. hath drawn away a great part of the ſtarres of our heaven, and caſt them to the earth; yet ſtill ſome abide in their orbes to give light to this crooked Generation; and let us pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights to continue them, and to fix more and more burning and ſhining lights in our firmament, and ſuffer no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wandring ſtarres, <hi>Jude</hi> 13. and <hi>ignes fatuos</hi> to miſleade his people into bogs and precipices. What hath been ſpoken may ſerve</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to refute the errour of ſuch, as ſay and affirm, That there is no Miniſtery, the Apoſtles are dead, their calling ceaſed with them: of this opinion is <hi>Epiſcopius, Oſtorodius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Some affirm, that the Miniſters calling is onely for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſake, but a thing not neceſſary by Divine inſtitution. Some crie it down as uſeleſſe and needleſſe, and condemn the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Word, and Sacraments, as poor, low, empty, and naked things.</p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:168349:75"/>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from hence we may take notice of Gods great love to his Church, from time to time, raiſing up Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Teachers, whereby Sathans dominion is weakned, Chriſts kingdome advanced, being the means of daily intercourſe betwixt God and man; ſpeaking unto them as a man to his friend, and beſeeching them by us (through Chriſt) to be reconciled to him; it is a very ſad and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing when the Lord depriveth a Nation of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: when the Lord meant happineſſe to his people, he made them this promiſe, <hi>I will give you Paſtors according to my heart, which ſha feed you with knowledge and understanding;</hi> but to deprive you of this, is a token, that ruine and deſtruction is at hand, unthankfull are that people that will not acknowledge the wonderfull bleſſing of God in the Miniſtery: the want of this, doubtleſſe, is one of the greateſt judgments that can befall a people So the Lord threatneth <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11. to be debarred of the glad tydings of ſalvation, and not hear the ſound of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but wander in darkneſſe, and ignorance, muſt needs be a heart-breaking and heart-tormenting ſorrow: The Lord out of his love giveth Miniſters to his Church, and they are for their works ſake to be beloved, and prayed for; for if the Lord ſhould totally eclipſe theſe Lights, it would be the darkeſt, and diſmall'ſt day that ever your eyes beheld. Divines have ſeverall opinions upon that place of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal</hi> 45 9. <hi>

Others of thoſe degrees and orders in the Church, <hi>Some Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the embroideries of the Church; with theſe the Lord doth clothe her, and make her happy; without which, ſhe is poor and naked. Oh! where is your, and the Nations thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe? what could God Almighty have done more, that he hath not done, ſending Labourers into his Vineyard? ſome ploughing up the fallow ground, others binding the broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, leaving no means unattempted to make us happy; yet have we not manifeſted our thankfulneſſe to the Father of Lights, for giving us ſuch Lights Nay, rather doe not many contemn and deſpiſe, revile, and rayle againſt them, and look upon them as the every ſcum and off ſcouring of the earth? They, whoſe lips God hath ſeaſoned, and ſeal'd to preſerve knowledge, are held contemptible; and their feet foule, that bring the faireſt meſſage: the Prophets labour to cure <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> labours to kill her Prophets, a ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital! Many kill us whom we would cure (though not in our naturall) yet in our civill life, our reputation; though we feel not actuall murtherings, we are ſenſible of cruell murmurings. <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> tongue made him a perſecutor, aſwell as <hi>Eſau</hi>'s hand. I tremble to conſider to what malice and envy this holy calling is expoſed, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We are made a gazing-ſtock to the world, to men, and Angels,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.9. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Satanaſius, Cyprian</hi> called <hi>Caprian, Paul</hi> accounted mad, CHRIST reputed a Conjurer, caſting out Devils through <hi>Reelzebub</hi> the chief of Devils. In our own cauſe we are to be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:168349:76"/>ſilent, in Gods cauſe zealous; for private injuries we are to paſſe them by with a <hi>Father forgive them:</hi> but when the cauſe of the Goſpel ſuffers, and is wounded in the reproach of the Miniſtery, we are not to be ſilent. Chriſt when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he was perſecuted, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. &amp;c. but when accuſed of blaſphemy, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.15. he anſwers, he makes apologie for himſelf, and confutes his adverſaries by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall arguments, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. and ſo on. But more of this in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> if God give his Church this priviledge of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, they may expect a priviledge of God, that is, protection; Hath his wiſdome ſent them? and ſhall not his power protect them? <hi>I ſend you forth in the midſt of wolves;</hi> 'tis true: but the ſame Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am with you alwaies, &amp;c.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is ſent to a rebellious Nation, impudent Children, ſtiffe-necked, <hi>Ezek</hi> 2.3, 4. but obſerve what followeth, <hi>verſes</hi> 5, 6. <hi>and they, whether they will hear, &amp;c.</hi> We muſt fight with Beaſts, as did S. <hi>Poul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 32. with ravening Wolves, with Devils un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Saints.

What are we?—<hi>your mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings are not againſt us, but againſt the Lord.</hi> The diſgraces of Gods Prophets and Miniſters are alwaies rewarded with Gods judgments. <hi>Paſhur</hi> ſmites, and ſtocks <hi>Jeremy, Jer.</hi> 20 2. but God changeth his name, <hi>Paſhur</hi> into <hi>Magor,</hi> that is, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority into fear. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſtretcheth his hand againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but his hand preſently dries up, and he cannot pull it in again, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.4. The boyes of <hi>Bethel</hi> that ſcoffed <hi>Eliſha</hi> were rent in pieces with Bears, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2. The mocking of his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers doth hale down on their own heads the wrath, even the remedileſſe wrath of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16.

                        <hi>Tully,</hi> making the ſame diſtinction betwixt a Learned man and an ignorant, as betwixt an ordinary Man and a Beaſt. (ertainly Learning is of great and unvaluable eſtimate, and bringeth to the enjoyers thereof many unſpeakable and unſenſible helps and furtherances, which as it was well ſpoken of the benefits of health, <hi>Carendo potius, quam fruendo diſtinguuntur,</hi> their uſe is beſt diſcerned by their want. Learning is like to fire and water, which are moſt neceſſary for the daily behoof of mans life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moderately and diſcreetly uſed; otherwiſe Experience teacheth the ſimpleſt, that if they be applied to hurtfull pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes there are not any more dangerous and hurtfull Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: which gave occaſion to <hi>Luther</hi> to ſay, <hi>Nunquaus pericli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur religio niſi inter Reverendiſſimos,</hi> Religion never comes into greater danger than amongſt the right Reverend. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts have a rule, <hi>Omne malum à Sacerdotibus,</hi> No evil that comes not from the Prieſts. Learning (I ſay) is requiſite, I mean not the Cobwebs of Learning, which have more wit than art, more art than uſe; nor the diſtorted and idle Gloſſes of the Canoniſts, which burthens a mans memory, but bettereth not his intellect; but the Learning that is helpfull for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the deep and profound things of God. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia Scholaſtica multis modis Sophiſtica,</hi> School Divinity is little better than meer Sophiſtry. <hi>Plus argutiarum quàm doctrinae, plus doctrinae quàm uſus,</hi> It hath more quickneſs than ſoundneſs, more ſauce than meat, more difficulty than doctrne, more doctrine than uſe.</p>
                     <p>Here I might take ſome time to decipher to you the miſery of this Age of ours.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you have many Septicks, meer Queſtioniſts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themſelves in Genealogies, and matters impertinent: preach Riddles and Paradoxes, which the people admire, but not apprehend, and make this frivolous uſe of all, This was a deep Sermon.

                        <note place="margin">Demoſth.</note> 
                        <hi>ſed etiam ſculpta,</hi> matters of weight, not notions, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſome cannot doe their Meſſage aright, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for they run before they be ſent, not having eaten the little Book that Saint <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> were commanded to eat, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. They given counſell before they receive it of the Lord, they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:168349:78"/>preach without any meditation, onely turn the cock, and let the water run. Extemporall preaching is ſuch a levity as works a light conceit of preaching; it ſhould not come from a light imagination, but a ſerious meditation of the heart in grounded knowledge, <hi>Bernard's faithfull Shepherd, p.</hi> 12. Fiſhers of men ſhould be, as the Apoſtles (when they were fiſhers) who were not alwaies caſting in their nets, but ſometimes mending them. So if theſe men be alwaies feeding others by their preaching, and never feeding themſelves by reading and meditation, they will prove but dry nurſes in a while, and unfit to give the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milke of the Word. I leave theſe Ciphers, which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of themſelves, onely ſeem to raiſe the figure to a higher number.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſome dare not doe their meſſage aright; they gild ragged walls and rotten poſts, daub with untemper'd morter, and ſow pillowes under the elbowes of ſinners, ſaying, Peace, peace, where there is no peace, ſpeaking ſmooth things and propheſying deceits, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30 10, 11 <hi>verſes.</hi> So did ſome to <hi>Micaiah,</hi> all the Prophets, which are four hundred, ſpeak good to the King, <hi>Let thy word I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and ſpeak that which is good,</hi> 1 King. 22.13. All their doctrine is <hi>Placentia;</hi> and thus by their flattery they puffe men up with an opinion that they are more than indeed they are. I leave theſe to anſwer for their cowardiſe, when they appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſome will not; they are like <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> who was a ſtrong Aſſe, couching down under two burthens, and ſaying, <hi>Reſt is good.</hi> Such an one was <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, who was more fit to keep the Caſtle of Saint <hi>Angelo</hi> againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth King of <hi>France,</hi> than to lead the flock of God againſt the invaſions of Sathan. Chriſt will not take <hi>Peters</hi> love to be ſincere, unleſs he feed his Lambs: he will not have the ſheep of his fold to wander in a wilderneſſe without a guide.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſome though they diſcharge their duty, and preach zeale, and knowledge, yet it is to no purpoſe; they give good Oracles out of <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, they ſay, but doe not; their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe overthrows all, which makes the people thinke of ſome great myſterie of Atheiſme never yet imparted to them. S. <hi>John
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:168349:78"/>Bapriſt</hi> ſhould be their pattern, who was a ſhining and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light, ſhining with knowledge, and burning with zeal.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, ſome miniſter medicines not to eaſe a burthened heart, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> but to put lightneſſe into the brains, ſcarring Religion out of her wits.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, ſome miniſter in this place, in that place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> in every place, in no place, imitating the Apoſtles (they ſay) ringing the changes of opinions, and run a Serpentine courſe, abjuring now, what yeſterday they embraced and warranted, winding from errour to errour, as Dolphins in the water; turning like Fannes on the houſe-top with every new blaſt of Doctrine; Reeds ſhaken with every Guſt (contrary to the teſtimony of S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>) theſe are madding Phyſitians.</p>
                     <p>But what neceſſity is there of Learning? <label type="milestone">

                        </label> it was not ſo with the Apoſtles, Chriſt did not chooſe the diſputants of the world, whoſe wit was great; nor the Phariſees, whoſe credit was great; nor the Prieſts, whoſe authority was great: but he called ignorant poor Fiſhers, of little worth, and leſſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Chriſts extraordinary call is no rule to us: <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Thirdly, obſerve, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that though they were at firſt rude and unlearned, yet he furniſhed them with all ſorts of knowledge, and variety of Languages; he did fit and qualifie them for that high and honourable calling. Chriſt made them Starres in his firmament, from him they received light, and communicated it to others; the extraordinary call of the Apoſtles is no rule for the ordinary call of Miniſters; they are to be qualified accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canons of the Apoſtles, <gap reason="foreign">

To be deſtitute of Learning and outward helps of knowledge, is to dance in the dark; for one means of attaining it, is the meditating of divine Scriptures, and the reading of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Authours: Arts have their uſe and ought not to be deſpiſed ſo long as (like an obedient <hi>Haga</hi>) they ſerve <hi>Sarah</hi> with neceſſary helps.

Why ſaith he if for nothing elſe, yet herein it will advantage him, that when he comes to the Theatre he ſhall not ſit like one ſtone upon another. Let the Book of God be the higheſt in our eſtimation, but let not others be in contempt. None but juggling Empricks, and ſottiſh Enthuſiaſts will condemn all Learning: for, they ſpeake falſly that ſay it tyes the Holy Ghoſt to a Pen and Inkhorn; it is of uſe and may be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to bring us to a higher pitch, Empericks indanger not more bodies, than Ideotiſh Prieſts, ſouls. Barbariſme is groſſe in an Oratour, Ignorance in a Phyſician, Dulneſſe in an Advocate, Rudeneſſe in a Miniſter.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are bearers of the Lords veſſels, not material, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but ſpiritual, and therefore ſhould be holy. The Aegyptian Prieſts might not taſt Wine, nor the Roman Prieſts touch a Bean. Drunkenneſſe is ſignified by the one, and unchaſt Luſt by the other. Holy Sacrifices, and an unholy Sacrificer, doe ill agree.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Paſtors of Gods Church ought to be enſamples to Chriſts flock: <hi>Vita Clericorum,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Libri Laicorum,</hi> The lives of the Clergie, the books of the Laitie, ſaith one of the Fathers, The Converſation of the Prieſt, the Looking-glaſſe of the People. The Prophet calleth <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the firſt Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Goſpel: a voice, not a ſound, <hi>Viva vox,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> that is, both <hi>vita &amp; vox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They ought to be holy in reſpect of themſelves; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For when no place either of Logick, or Rhetorick can perſwade, yet the Reaſon drawn from <hi>Lucrum</hi> and <hi>Damnum</hi> will not fail. Now the loſſe is of the two greateſt things that man hath, the loſſe of his name, and the loſſe of his ſoul. In the day of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall aſſiſe of the world, the propheſying in Chriſts name will not ſerve for an anſwer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. but then there ſhall be a reply and ſentence together, <hi>I know you not; depart from me,</hi> &amp;c. For God ſhall judge not after the doctrine, but after the life of the Miniſter, and every man ſhall receive according to his works. That which the Jewes ſpake falſly of Chriſt, is verified
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:168349:81"/>of ſuch Prophets, that though they ſave others, yet themſelves they cannot ſave. For he that denounceth Gods judgments on thoſe ſins, which himſelfe committeth, is his own condemner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1. and Chriſt in the laſt day ſhall ſay unto him, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. ver. 22. <hi>Out of thine mouth will I judge thee thou wicked ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ille ſolus praedicat viva voce, qui praedicat vita &amp; voce,</hi> He preacheth moſt that liveth beſt. All things in a Divine ſhould preach, his apparell, his diet, his expreſſions, and actions, being walking Sermons, Epiſtles, and Goſpels. A Goſpel-Miniſter muſt be an example in word, and converſation, according to that of <hi>Hierome, Omnia in Sacerd te debent eſſe vocalia;</hi> The Prophets are ſaid to be holy Prophets, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. ver. 70. holy by place taken from amongſt others, and conſecrated to this high calling. So <hi>Calvin,</hi> holy by grace, and ſanctification, for <hi>holy</hi> &amp; <hi>Prophets</hi> are <hi>Voces convertibiles.</hi> As good Preachers are <hi>Lux mundi,</hi> The Light of the world: So, Bad are <hi>Tenebrae mundi,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> Fogs and miſts; they give good Oracles out of <hi>Moſes</hi> Chaire, they ſay, but doe not; their practiſe overthrows all, which makes the people think of ſome great myſterie of Atheiſme never yet imparted to them: In currant coin three things are obſerved, good mettall, right ſtamp, and juſt weight; if we preach well, and live ill, our mettall is good, but our ſtamp bad; if we live well, and preach ill, our ſtamp is good, but our mettall bad; but if we both preach, and live well, our peny is good ſilver. It is <hi>Vatablus</hi> his obſervation out of the 30. chap. of <hi>Exod.</hi> v. 13. that the weights and meaſures of the Sanctuary, that is, the ſickle, talent, and cubit were of a double bigneſſe to thoſe of common uſe; denoting that the virtues of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Sanctuary ſhould be of a double proportion to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Hemyngius</hi> in his <hi>Peſtill,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dom. <hi>2.</hi> poſt Paſch</note> tells us of four ſorts of Miniſters, The firſt neither teach well, nor live well; Theſe pull down the Church of God with both hands, of which ſort S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S <hi>Jude</hi> foretold us there ſhould be many in the latter daies, not <hi>Lux,</hi> but <hi>Tenebrae mundi,</hi> Not the Light, as Miniſters ſhould be, but the Darkneſſe of the world. Theſe are not Goſpel-Phyſitians, but Italian Quack ſalvers. A ſecond ſort are ſuch as teach well, but live ill, theſe ſet up the Temple of God with one
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:168349:81"/>hand, and pull it down with another; that build up Heaven with their Voice, but Hell with their Life. It is the Life, not the Learning of the Preacher that perſwadeth the people. <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det loquentis vita, non oratio.</hi> Sin ſingle in the people, is double in the Preacher, for he offendeth both <hi>Peccato</hi> and <hi>Exemplo;</hi> It is both <hi>Scandalum populi, &amp; odium Miniſterii,</hi> even <hi>ſcandalum</hi> in both theſe ſenſes; an offence unto the people, and a ſcandal to his calling. Thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf? The Iſraelites abhor the offerings of the Lord, through the ſins of the Prieſts, the ſons of <hi>Eli:</hi> and ſuch a Miniſter may look for at the mouthes of the people the check in the Proverb, <hi>Loripedem rectus &amp;c.</hi> and that which is <hi>John</hi> 9.34. thou art altogether a ſinner, teacheſt thou us? <hi>Quid verba audiam, cùm facta videam?</hi> What ſhould we heed what thou preacheſt, when we ſee how thou liveſt? Suſpecting Religion to be but Policy, and imagining if their Doctrine were true, they would not croſſe it by their practiſe.</p>
                     <p>A third ſort are ſuch as teach ill, but live well. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This is an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical trick of Heretical Miniſters covering the bitterneſſe of the pill with gold; and while men gaze at their outward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, they be eaſily made to ſwallow the dregs and drugs of their hereſie. Their auſterity ſhall be ſtricter than <hi>John Baptiſts,</hi> but not with intent to bring one ſoule to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>A fourth ſort are ſuch as teach well, and live well, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> being <hi>Doctores, &amp; Ductores,</hi> Feeders, and Leaders: to ſincerity of Doctrine, there muſt be joyned integrity of Life; to <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> there there muſt be <hi>Thummim,</hi> Light of underſtanding and perfection of life. Who, ſaith our Saviour, can convince me of ſin?

Yet thus much I can ſay for him, That his opinion is ſo qualified, that it affordeth little or no advantage to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors, nor openeth a door to that <hi>Chaos</hi> of confuſion which they would introduce: For albeit he might hold, That all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be equally Prieſts, having the ſame power in the Word and Sacraments; Yet he denieth, that any may uſe or exerciſe this power, without the conſent of the Community, or calling of a Superiour. <hi>In lib. de capt.

                     <p>This opinion, as it is not ſound, ſo neither is it abſurd or much inconvenient: For, as a Miniſter that hath that power by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ordination, cannot loſe that power by Degradation, or otherwiſe, becauſe it is a gracious gift never to be reiterated, and called by the Schoolmen (how properly I know not) <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter indelebilis:</hi> So by degradation &amp;c. he may be reſtrained from the uſe and exerciſe of this power; and if he uſe it before reſtitution, he ſinnes.

But Miniſters, they are his Servants in ordinary neer unto him, and after a ſpecial manner employed in the ſervice of Jeſus Chriſt. Other men may ſerve God, and yet walk in their callings: but Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers have no other calling, but to ſerve God, to bring Soules into his Sheepfold, and to enlarge his kingdome. The ſpiritual Labourer is worthy of his hire; but if he labour for hire only, he may make himſelf merry with his reward on Earth, Heaven hath none for him. That good is well done that is done of conſcience. If then they are Gods ſervants, they are not their own Maſters. They have a Maſter, even God, whoſe they are, and for whom, and from whom they come; and therefore, for their Maſter's ſake, to be beloved, and honoured: <hi>He that despiſeth you,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>despiſeth me.</hi> God will eſteem the wrongs of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as done to himſelfe; their diſhonour is his own.

They are not common Ambaſſadors, but <hi>Legati à latere,</hi> Stewards of his hidden ſecrets: If an honour to a Subject from an Earthly King, much more to a poor Worm, [Man,] to be Ambaſſadour to the King of kings: for, what is an Apoſtleſhip, but the Lords Ambaſſage? A title of ſuch honour as Chriſt himſelf diſdained not to be called an Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. They bring the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of reconciliation betwixt God and Man. The Lord hath honoured us to be inſtrumental to tie this knot, yet for the hand of the moſt High God to perfect: He vouchſafeth this honour to us as his Inſtruments, that we in his name, and power, ſhall tye a double knot on Earth, not onely temporal, but Eternal of the believing Soule to her husband CHRIST. Not that we have power of our ſelves; for, were we all <hi>Boanergeſes,</hi> the ſons of Thunder, we are not able without him to turn your hearts to righteouſneſſe; it is Chriſt that muſt clear the eye, undeaf the eare, unlock the heart, and ſhake the inmoſt power of the ſoul, as the thunder ſhakes the wilderneſſe: It is by our Miniſtery, not our authority that your Souls are converted. Let the power be aſcribed to God, not to us. It is no ſmall honour to be Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to the King of kings, Miniſters of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>

                     <p>Eighthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> they are Gods Labourers, not in mean things; but in the Word, farre more excellent than either gold, or pretious ſtones, <hi>Job</hi> 28. than the Gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> than much fine gold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. This is that Jewel which the Merchant in the Goſpel bought with the ſale of his whole ſubſtance; the Word, the immortal Word of God. Now that that is of price, muſt needs be of eſtimation; that, that is profitable, is honourable: and truly were there no other Reaſon but this, that they hold forth the Word of God, the ordinary means of ſalvation; the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and inſtrument of bleſſedneſſe, and everlaſting life, it were enough to prove the dignity of their calling. I might proceed to other Names, and Titles, there being no leſſe than two and twenty in Scripture that denote their worth and dignity, but this may ſuffice. Truly, Brethren, we live in an Age, whereof it may be ſaid, <hi>Innumerae peſtes Erebi glomerantur in unum.</hi> The miſchiefs of Hell are ſwarmed to one round; and the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Dumah, Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> may all be found in <hi>England:</hi> and this ſin of the contempt of the Miniſtery is not the leaſt, it was one ground of a day of Publick Faſting not long ſince; and it may be one ground, of our daily, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual lamenting, to ſee this high and honourable calling ſo baſe and vile in peoples opinion. The <hi>Galatians</hi> received S. <hi>Paul</hi> as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:168349:88"/>an Angel of God, yea as Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14. but many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre their Swine before them. The Word of God is the Plow of the Lord, the People the Husbandry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9 The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are his Oxen to work at his plow, to break up the fallow ground, and to tread out the corn. Now how be their mouthes muzzled, and they that feed others have nothing to feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, tyed to the rack and manger? But alas! this is not all, how are they rayled on, reviled, traduced, their name and fame blaſted, as if they were the ſcum, and off ſcouring of the earth? It is moſt unnatural for a man to deſpiſe his brother the ſonne of his own father, it is a brand ſet upon the tongue that muſt burn with unquenchable flames, that it ſpake againſt his Brother, and ſlandred his own Mothers Son, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.20. but greater is their ſin, and leſſe cannot their puniſhment be, that not onely condemn their brethren, but vilifie their Fathers, thoſe whom God hath choſen as inſtruments of their ſpiritual good and ſalvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. When the Lord would brand the Iſraelites with a mark of the greateſt reproach, he ſaith, <hi>Thy people are as they that rebuke the Prieſt,</hi> Hoſ. 4 4. <hi>[as]</hi> is here taken abſolutely, they are ſuch as indeed Rebuke the Prieſt; they were not onely impatient of reproof, but which was more, they contended with their Teachers. They leſſoned them that would not be leſſoned by them, and rebuked thoſe by whom they were rebuked; they were grown ſo inſolent, and impudent in their ſins that they durſt defend them againſt their Reprovers, and ſpeak proudly, and preſumptuouſly againſt the Meſſengers of God. This is a common diſeaſe, and plague of this Nation, that in every Town, and City, the people are as they that rebuke the Prieſts. That impudent and inſolent claim is made ordinary in theſe daies; With our tongues we will prevail, for our lips are our own, no calling or degree is free from ſuch. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude at this time; That the diſgraces of Gods Prophets, be they in word, or in deed, are alwaies rewarded with Gods judgments. The boyes of <hi>Bethel</hi> that ſcoffed at <hi>Eliſha</hi> were rent in pieces with Bears, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. The mockers of his Meſſengers doe hale down on their own heads the wrath, even the remedileſſe wrath of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 36.16. The diſgraces done to them, the Lord accounts as done to himſelf, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.8. <hi>What are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:168349:89"/>we? your murmurings are not againſt us, but againſt the Lord. David</hi> accounted the abuſe offered to his Meſſengers as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to himſelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.5. And our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that desp ſeth you despiſeth me, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 10.16. They ought to be had in honour, and eſtimation, becauſe of their meſſage. They bring the glad tydings of ſalvation; and, <hi>how beautifull are their feet &amp;c?</hi> I ſpeak this to the ſhame of ſuch that have no more reckoning of their Miniſters, than the Aegyptians of their Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.34. Every Sheep-keeper was an abomination to the Aegyptians: Theſe, like the Devil, will ſmite <hi>Job</hi>'s ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when he cannot ſmite <hi>Job</hi> himſelf: The Jewes will ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingly ſay, <hi>Is not this the Carpenter's Son?</hi> Many will make uſe of any thing that may diſgrace them, but not conſider them in the worthineſſe of their calling, in the weight of their meſſage, or in any thing that may adde to their commendation. I leave ſuch as the mothes of a mans name and fame, the Cankerworms of the Church, the diſturbers of peace, and enemies of God and goodneſſe, who durſt they, would aſwell ſhoot out their black tongues againſt God, as againſt his ſervants.</p>

                        <hi>LEt a man ſo account of us as the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of &amp;c.</hi>] The primitive Chriſtians did cleave unto the Apoſtles, and were greatly affected to them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Ye received me</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>as an Apoſtle of God, even as Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> This is a duty the Scripture enjoyns; as there is a duty from a Wife to Husband, from Servant to Maſter, from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Superiour, ſo from a People to their Miniſter, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. ſo 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The Elders that rule well, are worthy of double honour, &amp;c.</hi> Many in all their life-time never make any reckoning of them, till pain, grief, and ſickneſſe enforce them; and then they muſt be ſent for, and entreated for counſel and advice, direction, and prayer; and whom they never loved living, they ſeem to have reſpect to dying: thus the Athenians dealt with <hi>Themiſtocles;</hi> they uſed him (as he ſaith of himſelf) like a tree, in fair weather little regarded, but in a ſtorm fled to for ſhelter; God did give honour to the builders of his mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Tabernacle in calling them by name, <hi>Exod</hi> 35.30.<note place="margin">Barker.</note> and they doe diſhonour the builders of his ſpiritual Temple in calling them out of their name. You know that in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they have a Commiſſion from God, and being commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated they are not to be ſlighted: though the perſon be mean of himſelf, his Commiſſion gives him worth. And again, in reſpect of themſelves, they are to be reſpected; for, were it not for the Miniſtery, you would be debarred of the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of ſalvation, be never ſhipt with Chriſt in Baptiſme, ſayle with him in the pinnace of the Church, nor anchor at the haven
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:168349:90"/>of happineſſe. When the Lord would brand the Iſraelites with a mark of the greateſt reproach, (as I ſaid before) he ſaith, <hi>Thy people are as they that rebuke the Prieſt.</hi> Hoſ. 4.4. They were grown ſo inſolent, and impudent in their ſins, that they durſt defend them againſt their Reprovers, and ſpeak proudly and preſumptuouſly againſt the Meſſengers of God, and therefore the Lord ſets down the greatneſſe of their ſin, <hi>The people are as they that rebuke the Prieſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this reverence and eſteem due to the Miniſters of the Goſpel conſiſts in four things:<note place="margin">Reverence to the Miniſt. conſiſts in four things.</note>

Chriſt ſaid of the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.3. <hi>Quae dicunt facite,</hi> doe as they ſay, but not as they doe; <hi>Dicunt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim quae Dei ſunt, faciunt quae ſua ſunt,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> they doe their own works, but ſpeak the Lords Word; and therefore ſo long as the Preachers deliver the wholſome words of the Lord Jeſus, you muſt entertain them, and their meſſage as the Angels of God. He that commeth into the publick place to entrap the Miniſter, and carp at his word, commeth to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and abuſe the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, whoſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:168349:90"/>Servants they are, and whoſe meſſage they bear; <hi>He that is of God,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>heareth Gods word,</hi> Joh. 8.47. and you hear them not, becauſe ye are not of God; you ſee the cauſe why they hear not, becauſe they are not of God. As men and women, they were of God his off-ſpring, but as malitious and envious, ſo of the Devil. A like expreſſion S. <hi>John</hi> hath, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.6. <hi>He that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us.</hi> By this Rule, ſaith <hi>Hemyngius,</hi> examine thy ſelf whether thou be Gods childe, or the Devils ſervant; he that with a good will and honeſt heart heareth Gods Word, hath Chriſts Record that he is of God; but he that heareth the Word to carp and ſnatch at it, and perſecute he Meſſenger, is of the Devil. It is a poſitive truth, that no childe of God cometh into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to hear his Word, but with Godly reverence, due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and carefull attention. It is an Argument of a hard and ſtubborn heart, of a ſon of <hi>Belial,</hi> to ſleight the Word of God, how weak and mean ſoever the Organ or inſtrument be; I doe declare that they fearfully ſinne againſt God that doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem the preaching and meſſage of the Servants of God, and doe procure to themſelves the wrath and anger of the Lord. <hi>They that hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> that is, the Law and Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>they will not believe though one ariſe from the dead,</hi> Luke 16.31. It was S. <hi>Paul</hi> complaint of <hi>Alexander,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15. He greatly withſtood our words: not our perſon, which had been a breach of charity; but our preaching, which was a direct offence againſt piety. Much to be condemned are they that will not hear, and ſo are careleſſe; that carp, and ſnatch at what they hear, and ſo are malitious; or will have nothing but <hi>placentia,</hi> ſmooth and pleaſant things ſpoken to them; ſo rip up the ſwelling of their hypocriſie, make bare their wickedneſſe, detect their ungodly proceedings, and then they will flie in your faces with, <hi>Away with ſuch a man from the face of the earth.</hi> The Devil ſtirres not till God rouze him; as the wilde Bore ſleeps till he be hunted. Let darkneſſe cover mens impieties, and their ſlumber is unmoleſted: produce them to light, and they cannot endure it. The ulcerous ſide full of dead fleſh feels not till you touch the quick. Let <hi>Elijah</hi> tell <hi>Ahab</hi> of his Idolatries, and <hi>John</hi> bloody <hi>Herod</hi> of his Luſts, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:168349:91"/>then <hi>thou art mine enemy.</hi> Many had rather goe to Hell faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, than to Heaven with their eyes open; to be lulled in the cradle of ſecurity, than awakened by the voice of God. Thus you ſee that reverence and eſteem to the Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel conſiſts, Firſt in carefull attention and diligent hearkning to their Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it conſiſts in the Reverend regard and eſtimation of their perſons. There is a Thief which entreth not by the door and cometh to deſtroy, beware of ſuch an one; and there is a good Shepherd, which entreth in at the door, and careth for the ſheep: know ſuch an one, and account of him, and have him in ſingular love for his works ſake. Why doth God ſtyle them <hi>Angels, Stewards, Ambaſſadours?</hi> Why doth he parle with them, enter them into commons, make them his fellow-commoners? one main Reaſon is, that you ſhould with the word have a reverend regard, and eſtimation of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe Exhortations, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>And we beſeech you brethren to know them &amp;c. And obey them that have the rule over you,</hi> Heb. 13. ver. 17. It is obſerved that the worſt men of a Pariſh regard a Paſtor the leaſt; one gives a Reaſon; they are like Legs and Arms out of joynt, and ſo cannot endure the touch of the Chirurgions hand, whoſe chief care is to worke their cure. He that is ſick of a Lethargie deſires to ſleep though he die for it, and he that is lulled aſleep in ſinne cannot away with the Watchman of God. Nothing is a greater trouble to him that loveth ſleep than to be kept awake. It maketh the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſoule cry out againſt the Miniſter, as thoſe againſt <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 22.22. <hi>Away with ſuch a fellow; he troubleth the City, Acts</hi> 16.20. when as they in their carnal ſecurity, malice, and envy, are the <hi>Ahabs</hi> that trouble <hi>Iſrael.</hi> None but the ſcum and refuſe of people, the moſt carnal-minded, are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, for from a loathing of their perſons, there followeth a deteſtation of their doctrine, the inſtrument of converſion and means of ſalvation; and ſo in the end, ruine and deſtruction. It is a ſad thing that many more affect &amp; take delight in variety of Teachers, than in verity of Doctrine. Brethren, the meaneſt Preacher whom God hath ſent you, can ſhew you that, which if you obediently follow,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:168349:91"/>ſhall effectually ſave you. The Word is powerfull, what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument ſoever bringeth it; and Gods ſtrength is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in our weakneſſe: it is not we by our Learning and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but God by his Spirit that muſt work you to himſelf. I have obſerved that this immoderate crying up of ſome to be <hi>Elijah</hi>'s and <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s to have their ſpirits redoubled on them, and the vilifying of others, have been a great cauſe of thoſe rents amongſt us; and Factions we may ſee thus kindled, which while we live, perhaps we ſhall not ſee extinguiſhed. <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollos, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, were ſuch cryes as bred in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> ſad diviſions, and make the Apoſtle conclude them not Chriſtians, but carnal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.34. <hi>For ye &amp;c.</hi> This way and courſe is a direct oppoſition to that unity and unanimity that God would have in his Church; for obſerving rather the diverſity of Inſtructors, than the unity of truth, there ariſeth in the end as many mindes as men, as many Sects as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as many Goſpels as Goſſips; for, ſchiſmes, hereſies, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and confuſion, are the effects of Chriſtians unchriſtian diviſions: and therefore if ye would not be thought carnal, ceaſe from partiality, and carry a loving affection and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eſteem towards all the Servants &amp; Ambaſſadors of Chriſt. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> ſo I of them, <hi>Receive them in the Lord with all gladneſſe, and hold ſuch in reputation,</hi> Phil. 2.29. Doe not diſcourage them, either by contempt of their perſons, or doctrine. I ſpeak not this as to any one particular: I neither ſtand or fall, by the opinion of any. When a Miniſter firſt ſteps into the Miniſtery, he is to conſider he is as a Lamb amongſt Wolves. S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> came neither eating nor drinking, and yet the people ſaid, <hi>he had a Devil:</hi> CHRIST came eating and drinking, and they ſaid, <hi>he was a glutton, and a wine bibber; The Servant is not greater than his Maſter;</hi> He muſt not (ſaith S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his 6. <hi>Hom: de laudibus Pauli</hi>) enter into this high and holy calling, except he be willing to ſuffer a thouſand deaths. I thought good to let you know your duty in theſe times, in which ſo much contempt and contumely is thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and this high and honourable calling is eſteemed baſe and contemptible. We may juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain with the Prophet, <hi>We are wearied with men,</hi> Iſa. 7.13.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:168349:92"/>With the other Prophet, that <hi>We are wondred at,</hi> Zach. 3.8. And with the Apoſtle, that <hi>We are made a ſpectacle unto the world, to Angels, and to men,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.9. <hi>And are as the filth of the world, and off ſcouring of all things unto this day,</hi> verſe 13. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and diſobedience of Gods meſſage and Meſſengers, may be eaſily perceived by comparing peoples practiſe with our preaching.</p>
                     <p>I come now to a third thing: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The <hi>eſteem</hi> and <hi>respect</hi> to the Miniſters of the Goſpel conſiſteth in their <hi>proviſion</hi> and <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi> not onely in a carefull &amp;c. <hi>For if we ſow ſpiritual things, is it a great matter that we ſhall reap your carnall things? Doe ye not know that they which wait at the Altar are partakers with the Altar,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.11, 13.

I am (I confeſſe) upon an unpleaſant ſubject: I crave your attention, I matter not your cenſure. So great was Gods care under the Law of the Levites, that he gave to his people both <hi>mandat,</hi> and <hi>caveat,</hi> precept and counſel. <hi>Mandat,</hi> Numb. 35.2. <hi>Command the children of Iſrael that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their poſſeſſion. Caveat,</hi> Deut. 12.19. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf that thou for ſake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.</hi> Now it will follow (were there no Texts in the New Teſtament) that Gods care is not leſſe of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, than of the Miniſters of the Law. Obſerve what inference the Apoſtle makes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9, 10, 11. I reade of Chriſt (who came to fulfill all Righteouſneſs) that as he paid tribute unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſo he offered his duties unto the Temple, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.24. The Miniſter is Gods workman, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in the ſalvation of his peoples ſouls: his work calls for wages from the people, or a woe unto the people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.13. The Miniſters are both the ſowers in the ſeed-time, and the ſhearers in the harveſt; The cry of their hire, aſwell as others, if it be detained, it will enter into the ears of the Lord, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.4. The Miniſters are Lamps; and ſhall the people look to have them burn, and not finde them oyle? ſhall there be Oxen, where the crib is empty? or will the Eagles flie where there is no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſe?
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:168349:92"/>They are Chriſts ſouldiers, and <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>goeth on warfare on his own charges; none feeds a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.7. They ſeem to put out the very light of nature in themſelves which repine at the reaſonable maintenance of them that miniſter before the Lord. Every change is full of peril, and alterations, and in this particular (though ſhadowed with the plauſible name of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>) it threatens nothing leſſe than the overthrow of Learning, and Religion. It was foreſeen (no doubt) by Gods Spirit, how the Miniſters of the Word ſhould be contemned, how injuriouſly dealt withall, what havock and ſpoyle ſhould be made of the Church: which moved him to thoſe Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12. It is written of the Chriſtians in the life of <hi>Nero,</hi> that they preſerved the ſtate, yet dogs muſt devour them: They made <hi>Aurelius</hi> his Army to proſper, yet <hi>Chriſtianos ad Leones,</hi> Threw the Chriſtians to the Lyons. It hath ever been the poſie of the Church, <hi>Facere bonum, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere malum,</hi> To doe good, and to ſuffer evil: So Chriſt himſelf ſped; He healed, and was hurt; He pitied, and was mocked; He ſaved others, himſelf was killed. The colour of our Livery on Earth, is either black, or red; mourning, or perſecution; the armes of the Church is the Croſſe, Woe unto thoſe that adde croſſes to the Croſſe, and grow rich by the poverty of the Church and her Servants.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Biſhop</hi> King.</note> It was the ſaying of a Learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in his Lectures on <hi>Jonas,</hi> Time was that Religion did eat up Policy, and the Church devoured the Common wealth; but now Policy eateth up Religion, and the Common-wealth devours the Church. Men are grown profeſſed Politicians: <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat Reſpublica copiis referta,</hi> Let the Common-wealth proſper, and what care we for the Church? Unlike that godly man, <hi>Me moriente vivat Eccleſia,</hi> whatſoever becomes of me, let the Church live &amp;c. I cannot conceive how men can plead their faith in the Goſpel, and not reward thoſe that bring it: all the Devils in hell cannot take a directer courſe to overthrow the Miniſtery, than by taking away all their livelyhood. Perhaps ſome will pity, but what's that? others will afford ſome bare and naked praiſe; but we cannot, like Cameleons, live on the aire of commendations: thoſe that are driven to ſtudy how to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:168349:93"/>get bread to put in their mouthes, will with a heavy heart ſtudy for Sermons; and, I like not thoſe that preach without ſtudy, that turn the cock and let the water run. Oh unhappineſſe, unhappineſſe, miſery, miſery to devour holy things, and then to make enquiry, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25. But to wave this for the preſent, The Labourer is worthy of his hire, and woe to thoſe that doe detain it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.4. if the Labourers that reap our fields, much more thoſe that reap in the Lords Vineyard. Maintenance to the Miniſtery is not due <hi>ad modum Eleêmoſynae,</hi> as of alms and courteſie, but <hi>ad modum debiti,</hi> as their right and due. I ſhall not here diſpute the lawfulneſſe of Tythes; they were lawfull to the Prieſts, (there was no queſtion) <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.21. There is <hi>Mandat,</hi> and <hi>Caveat;</hi> and how they come to be taken away I know not, for there was no Law abrogated but the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and they were no part of it. Again, I finde no prohibition in the New Teſtament, but commendation of it: <hi>Ye obſerve,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mìnt, Aniſe, and Cummin, (and ye doe well.)</hi> The Phariſee was in this an honeſt man: our Saviour condemneth his hypocriſie, and ſo he did the hypocriſie of the Jewes in that they obſerved the ſmaller, but omitted the mightier matters of the Law, in boaſting of their little good, but neglecting mercy, and judgment: theſe things they ought to have done. That which I intend to hold out, is, that maintenance by the Law of God is due to a Goſpel Miniſter: ſo you may read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. from the 7<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> to the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the word &amp;c.</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be &amp;c.</hi>

This condemns ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly the practiſe of ſome in our Age, whoſe chief policie, yea piety (for with the Phariſee, they think they doe God good ſervice) is to ſtrip a Miniſter whom they diſlike of his Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and expoſe him and his family to want, and poverty; ſuch in the end will hale down judgments on their own heads: for be
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:168349:93"/>aſſured, with <hi>the ſame meaſure they mete, it ſhall be meaſured to &amp;c.</hi> It is CHRISTS Divine Rule, <hi>As ye would that men ſhould doe unto you, doe you alſo unto them; for &amp;c.</hi> If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, we ſhall ceaſe perſecution and cruelty, this biting and devouring one of another, leſt we be devoured one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15. The Merchants trade concerns our bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the Lawers occupation our goods, the Phyſitians art our body, all theſe have reſpect; but the Miniſters who have care of ſouls, lie diſregarded. <hi>Is not the life more worth than meat, and the body than rayment,</hi> Mat. 6. but the ſoule more pretious than all, <hi>Màt.</hi> 16.26? And yet carnal-Goſpellers envy not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious wealth of Merchants, of Lawyers, of Phyſicians; all is well if the Miniſter be poor, decreaſe his wages, encreaſe his work; get ſtraw where he can finde it, yet ſhall nothing of his labour be diminiſhed. They ſeem, I ſay, to have put out the very Light of Nature; they repine at the reaſonable maintenance of them that miniſter before the Lord: For, who plants a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and eats not of the fruits thereof? Or, who feeds a Flock, and eats not of the milke of the Flock? Mark how the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures both in the Law and the Goſpel doe beat upon this point: In the Law it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox;</hi> doth God take care for Oxen? No, his care is for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9, 10. Miniſters maintenance is not <hi>Humanum inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> but <hi>Divinum inſtitutum,</hi> verſe 14. And this Law is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, equitable, juſt, and conſcionable; for, if we ſow ſpiritual things, is it a great matter that we reap carnal things? It is an action that goeth currant without contradiction, <hi>Juſtitia ſuum cuique tribuit,</hi> Juſtice giveth to every man that which belongeth unto him: whoſoever therefore converteth to any prophane uſe that which is conſecrated to Gods ſervice, and for his uſe, robs God of his due, and takes his right from him; if you miſpend his Sabbath, that time ſet apart for his glory, you rob him; if you make a falſe entry on his free-hold, and prophane the place of his publick worſhip, you rob him. <hi>My houſe ſhall be called a houſe of prayer, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 21.13. <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> carowſed in the bowles of the Temple, but drank the draughts of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. And if you creep into Gods right, and let them ſtarve at the Altar that ſerve at the Altar; you rob God, and

Miſerable are they, that eat up ſheep and ſhepherds both, that grow rich out of the ruines of poor Miniſters, that turn <hi>Aram dominicam</hi> into <hi>haram domeſticam,</hi> the Lords Sanctuaries into ſwine-ſtyes and ſtables. <hi>William Rufus</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>Church bread was ſweet bread,</hi> but poor King he ſmarted for it. <hi>Balſhazzar</hi> took <hi>ſacrum de ſacro, Dan.</hi> 5. but he had better been without it. <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtata</hi> took away the Miniſters maintenance with intention to deſtroy the Miniſtery, but taſted of the fearfull hand of God. Oh his death was lamentable! it may well be verified of them all that thus deale, <hi>aurum habent Tholoſanum,</hi> it will be ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the mouth, but bitterneſſe in the belly; I ſpeak this out of love and compaſſion to him that is guilty, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of thoſe that as yet have not conſented to ſo great wickedneſſe. The queſtion was once, <hi>What ſhall we bring to the man of God?</hi> Now it is a motion, <hi>What ſhall we take away from the man of God?</hi> Oh! be not proud of miſchief, be not fleſh't with fortunate wickedneſſe, and doe not triumph in unbleſt gain, for the loſer ſhall ſit down with content, when the winner ſhall lie down in torment, never value that profit, that will in the end prove uncomfortable. Thus much of the third thing, <hi>in what the eſteem and respect of the Miniſters of the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,</hi> viz: <hi>in their proviſion and maintenance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I come to the fourth thing, <hi>wherein the eſteem and respect to the Miniſters of the Goſpel conſiſts,</hi> and that is, <hi>in ſtanding by them and with them, as much as in people lies to encourage and help them</hi> No calling is expoſed more to ſcorn, and contempt; many make it their practiſe to broach falſe rumours of them, and as much as they can to throw dirt in their faces; when the Phariſees thought the Diſciples faulty, they go and tell Chriſt, <hi>Mat</hi> 12.2. when their Maſter Chriſt, then they goe and tell his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.11. they were reſtleſſe, and wretchleſſe: the limbs of Sathan, boldly open their mouths to ſpeak their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that impudent, and inſolent claim is made uſe of in theſe daies with our tongues, &amp;c. for our lips are our own. They are
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:168349:94"/>moſt hatefull people to God, and good men, that ſet their tougues to ſound nothing but detraction and ſlanders, as though their mouthes were the dung gate through which the filth of a City was carried forth. <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> ſtand for <hi>Paul,</hi> though they doe it with danger of their own lives, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.4. Who for my life, laid down their own necks, hazarded their lives for ſaving of mine. <hi>Thou ſhalt not</hi> (ſaith the Law) <hi>receive a falſe tale of any,</hi> Exod. 23.1. Much leſſe of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, a Servant, and Ambaſſadour of Chriſt. As thou muſt not be a nurſe of his ill fame, ſo let there be no room in thy heart to receive any report, for he that opens his mouth to detraction, is a thief, and he that opens his ears to entertain it, is a Receiver, and both of them carry the Devil with them, the one in his tongue, the other, in his eares; it is a true ſaying, <hi>There would not be ſo many Thieves, if there were not ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers:</hi> Even ſo, there would not ſo many rob the renown of his Miniſter, and clip his credit to make him lighter eſteemed, were it not that the Hearers open their eares to receive untrue and malitious reports. As a cordiall friend will ſpeak no evil, ſo he will not hear evil of his friend; it was a brand of <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> that they withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſighs forth a ſad complaint, <hi>No man ſtood with me, but all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook me, I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge,</hi> 2 Tim. 4 16. it was otherwiſe with the Galatians, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle giveth them this commendation, <hi>I bear you record that if it had been poſſible, ye would have pluckt out your own eyes and given them to me.</hi> But now we live in ſuch an Age that men are ſo ill tempered of the four Elements that they poſſeſſe ſeverall ſeats in them; all Earth in their hearts, all Water in their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, all Aire in their brains, all Fire in their tongues, and bent againſt none more than thoſe that they ſhould love and cheriſh. The poor Britans once tuned forth a ſad ſong to the conquering Romans, <hi>Etio ter Conſuli gemitus Britannorum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellunt nos Barbari ad mare, repellit nos mare ad Barbaros &amp;c.</hi> To the Roman Conſul the Britans ſend Groaning inſtead of Greeting, the Barbarous drive us upon the Sea, the Sea beats us back upon the Barbarous, hence we are endangered to a double kinde of death, either to be drowned, or to be killed; this is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:168349:95"/>the condition of many, how are they toſt from poſt to pillar, but eſpecially Miniſters, who lie liable to the greateſt perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thoſe as thick as the fiery Serpents in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with their venemous, and burning ſtings? Chriſts Cauſe, and Chriſt Croſſe, goe moſt commonly together, but here is our comfort, that if theſe rocks ſplit the bark of our life, yet our death is not <hi>mors,</hi> but <hi>immortalitas;</hi> not a death, but an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to life uncapable of dying. You have a ſort of men that delight in perſecution, it is their meat and drink; a moſt unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian quality and unlike God, who bids us <hi>be mercifull as. he is mercifull,</hi> Luke 6.36. where you have a precept <hi>[Be ye merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,]</hi> a pattern, (and it is the beſt) <hi>[as your &amp;c.] As</hi> is a note of quality, not equality: we cannot equall God in love, for all our mercifulneſſe is finite, his towards us infinite; and this is ſeen firſt in his pitty, <hi>he is pittifull,</hi> None ever could juſtly charge God of rigour, there is mercy even in Hell: pittiful he is <hi>in corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo, Not breaking the bruiſed reed, nor &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, his mercy is ſeen in his bounty, bountiful he is in <hi>porrigendo,</hi> giving to all, life, breath, and all things: as the mercies of the wicked are full of cruelty, the very judgments of God upon his ſervants are full of mercy: whence then proceeds that envy and cruelty in men? he ſpareth them in mercy, who in their malice neither ſpare God, nor men. Oh that men ſhould doe the works of the fleſh, and yet ſeem to live after the ſpirit! for ſo is hatred, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. <hi>The works of the fleſh</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are manifeſt,</hi> which are theſe, verſe 19. Oh that men ſhould offend againſt ſo many known precepts! <hi>Col.</hi> 3.8. &amp; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.31. <hi>Let all bitterneſſe, and wrath, and anger, and clamour be &amp;c.</hi> Again, if we conſider Chriſt, we ſhall ſee he manifeſted abundance of mercy. I cannot inſtance that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable love, which the true King, and Redeemer of the world hath made known to the ſons of men; when the heart of our Saviour was ploughed up with a ſpear, it ran ſtreams of mercy, reall mercy; which his vocall tongue interpreted, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgive them, they know not what they doe:</hi> his blood <hi>Heb.</hi> 22. had a voice, a mercifull voice. Beſide all this, it is apparent that unmercifulneſſe and cruelty is of the Devil; It is true, he can transform himſelf into an Angel of Light, and rather than
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:168349:95"/>not draw men to Hell, he will diſſemble a love to Heaven: he will ſpeak good, that he may work evil; and confeſſe the truth, that he may deceive with falſhood: he is full of ſubtilty, and cruelty, <hi>a Murtherer from the beginning:</hi> Though he play the Fox, yet he ends with the Lyon; blood, maſſacres, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are his ſofteſt embraces; horrour, and amazement, the pleaſures of his court; kill and ſlay, the language of his tongue; you ſee God and Chriſt give no ſuch pattern. Unmercifulneſſe and cruelty are works of the fleſh, againſt Divine precepts, and proceed from the infernall pit of darkneſſe: Oh never perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in that ſinne that is ſo croſſe to God, ſo repugnant to his Word, and pleads the Devil for its Authour. <hi>Command fine</hi> (ſaith <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi>) <hi>to come down from heaven:</hi> Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes them, ſaying, <hi>Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of,</hi> Luke 9.54, 55. You muſt know that perſecution is as well by the tongue, as by the hand; this wounds like a ſword, or ſharp ſpear: a foule-mouth'd man or woman is worſe than the Devil: for a man may avoid the Devil, <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flie from you;</hi> but we cannot reſiſt a ſlanderer and Railer. The world is as full of theſe, as <hi>Nilus</hi> of Crocodiles, <hi>Sodome</hi> of Sulphur, and <hi>Aegypt</hi> of Lice. <hi>A good name is a pretious ointment,</hi> and woe to them that bereave a man of it. Can the wound be cured, ſo long as the Iron remains in it? Can the Iron be cold ſo long as it remains in the Smiths forge? Can the River ceaſe running ſo long as the Fountain floweth? So the tongue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refrain evil ſpeaking, as long as hatred broils in the heart, <hi>For, out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,</hi> Luke 6.45.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:168349:96"/>nature, talking by cuſtome, ſaying by art: Children ſpeak, Fools talk, Learned men ſay: So <hi>Tully, Solius eſt Oratoris di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, Vulgi loqui.</hi> Oh let me then (for your ſouls are tender to me) perſwade you, to lay aſide all malice, envy, and evil-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. verſe 1. Not to perſecute any, eſpecially thoſe whom God hath depted his Servants, and Ambaſſadours, leſt you hale down judgments on your heads. Oh ſad, and to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented times that give encouragement to licentious tongues, for wherein ſtands moſt mens Religion, but in railing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling; that our Church is <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Sodome,</hi> that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have the mark of the Beaſt, are <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſſes,</hi> that our People are Swine and Dogs, they muſt not give that which is holy unto Dogs, &amp;c. That our Communion-Cup is <hi>Calix Diaboli,</hi> the Cup of the Devil; that <hi>Menſa Chriſti</hi> is <hi>Menſa Diaboli,</hi> the Table of Chriſt, the Table of the Devil; that our Pulpits are Tubs, our places of worſhip Steeple-houſes. Alas! what a ſad thing is this, doth the Goſpel teach ſcorn, and deriſion? are Chriſts followers, railers, and revilers? No, no. Such deſerve our pitty, and prayers, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they doe.</hi> Doe not, like the Phariſees, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Gods Church and Prophets, and when you have done, think you have done God good ſervice: the Devil I obſerve deceiveth under the faireſt vizard. When he tempted <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt, he ſheweth him the ſilver, not the halter. When he ſent <hi>Gehazi</hi> after <hi>Naaman,</hi> he ſuggeſts unto him the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the mony, not the Leproſie. He preſents unto Chriſt the glory of the world, not the vanity. He layes forth his wares to the faireſt ſhew. Do not, <hi>Ixion</hi>-like, take a Cloud for <hi>Juno.</hi> Let not Religion be a meer fancy, deceive not your ſelves under appearances, and think not that zeal which it conceits. Oh it is a heart-breaking to a devout ſoul to ſee hypocriſie made piety, to ſee men boaſt of Religion, and yet are but as ſounding braſs, and a tinkling Cymball. A Miniſter, ſaith a Father, <hi>Debet eſſe lugens ſua, &amp; aliena del cta,</hi> ought ſtill to be lamenting his own ſins, and the ſins of the people. Oh what abundance of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and ſpirituall pride is there amongſt men, conceiting highly of themſelves, and deſpiſing others, and of all men the moſt envious and cenſorious; if this be of the Spirit of Chriſt, I
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:168349:96"/>leave it to you to judge. I read that <hi>Pambo,</hi> a man utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned in the Scriptures, on a time came to S. <hi>Hierome</hi> to be taught ſome Scripture without book; he turned him to the firſt verſe of the 39 <hi>Pſalm, I ſaid I will take heed to my waies that I offend not in my tongue:</hi> a Leſſon very ſeaſonable and to be learned aſwell by the Scribes and Phariſees, as Publicans of our times. The good man being blamed for not reſorting unto his Tutour again in three moneths, anſwers, That he had not yet learned well his firſt leſſon; yea, and forty years after being asked the ſame, Anſw: that as yet he had not fully learned that leſſon: And indeed, let men and women pretend what Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they will, unleſſe they learn this leſſon, they learn nothing at all of goodneſſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.26. <hi>If any man among you ſeemeth to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans religion is but vain.</hi> The firſt leſſon that the wicked learn, their <hi>Alpha,</hi> yea, and <hi>Omega</hi> too, their firſt and laſt is <hi>to speak evil;</hi> ſo the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.3. <hi>The wicked ſpeak evil from their mothers womb.</hi> Oh that I could prevail with the profeſſing men &amp; women of our Age, that would be Guides of the blinde, and Inſtructers of the unlearned, that they would learn themſelves this leſſon <hi>to take heed to their waies, that &amp;c.</hi> Goe into your grounds in the dead of Winter, and of two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked trees you know not which is the ſound and which the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at heart, the Summer will give Chriſts mark, <hi>by their fruits you ſhall know them.</hi> Oh that people would ſhew leſſe, and doe more of goodneſſe, that they would learn not to know much, but to practice much; and as they hear, and repeat Sermons, ſo learn obedience; this is the life and power of godlineſſe. In a word, Love all, eſpecially the houſhold of faith, have bowels of compaſſion towards them, deſpiſe none, eſpecially the Miniſters of the Goſpel, much leſſe perſecute them, but ſtand by them, and with them, help, and encourage them, for they are the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt, and ſtewards of the myſteries of God.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Luke 10.16.</hi> Sheweth, that the contempt of the Miniſters of the Goſpel is a great and grievous ſinne; the reaſons of it, and how it expoſeth men to the wrath of God.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THey doe exceedingly aggravate their ſinnes that dare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and preſumptuouſly oppoſe themſelves againſt Gods Miniſters, returning reproofs for reproof, and inverting and perverting Gods own Order and Ordinance. The Law puniſhed this inſolency and preſumption even with death, as appeareth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.11, 12. The Lord inflicts a heavy judgment upon <hi>Corah</hi> and his Aſſociates for this very ſin, Contempt of the Miniſtery, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.11. <hi>What are we? your murmurings &amp;c.</hi> their ſinne was not againſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> but againſt God himſelf, and his Ordinance. It was not men they oppoſed, and deſpiſed; but God, the juſt One, the Lord. Seeing we are fallen upon theſe unhappy men, this rebellious rout; let us take a fuller view of them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. You have their Conſpiracy, <hi>They gathered themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Surrexerunt,</hi> they roſe, and made an Inſurrection. They made a ſchiſme, then a faction, and in the end a mutinous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, a rebellious inſurrection; the word is paſſive, <hi>They were gathered together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. You have the perſons, <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> &amp; <hi>Abiram,</hi> and <hi>On</hi> the Son of <hi>Pelech:</hi> here are not <hi>Sheba</hi> and <hi>Shimei,</hi> baſe Bethſhemites that roſe againſt <hi>David,</hi> empty fellowes, ſuch as roſe againſt <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> not <hi>Faex populi,</hi> a ſort of abject and contemptible men, but <hi>Corah</hi> the Son of <hi>Levi, Aaron</hi>'s Coſin-Germane, and <hi>Dathan, Abiraem,</hi> and <hi>On,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Reuben, Iſraels</hi> firſt-born; famous, eminent men, Captains of the people, men of renown. You may note that the head of this Conſpiracy is a Son of <hi>Levi, Corah;</hi> It is dangerous when inſurrection begins at the Sanctuary.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that <hi>Reuben</hi> joyns alſo; inſurrection hath ſharers. <hi>Corah</hi> is for the Mitre, <hi>Reuben</hi> for the Scepter: Let <hi>Moſes</hi> look to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:168349:97"/>his Throne, <hi>Aaron</hi> to his Chaire, <hi>Levi</hi> hath many things that will doe <hi>Reuben</hi> good; and <hi>Reuben</hi> therefore will be ſure to pleaſure <hi>Levi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, you have the perſons againſt whom this Inſurrection is made, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Magiſtrate and Miniſter.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Grievance; their uſurping of Rule over the people, <hi>You take too much &amp;c.</hi> and not onely Uſurpation, but Intruſion too, <hi>Why lift ye up your ſelves?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, you have the ground of this Grievance, <hi>the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is holy, every one of them, and what need of</hi> Aaron? <hi>the Lord is amongst them, what needs a Governour or</hi> Moſes? Here were glorious ſhews, and pretences: they charge <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> with Ambition and Intruſion, Vice rebukes Virtue, Humility challengeth Arrogance; when as their main end was to ruſh into their rooms, to poſſeſſe themſelves of their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Now obſerve, all this is not againſt them, but againſt God; the abuſe and affront offered to them, he takes as a diſhonour to himſelfe. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>What are we? your murmurings, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore he plagueth them in a ſtrange and unuſual manner, to be Enſamples to us, that we ſhould fear, and not doe ſo wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Their intent of a ſubverſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ends in the deſtruction of themſelves, <hi>for the Earth openeth her mouth, and ſwalloweth them down quick:</hi> We ſhould never read of this judgment, but it ſhould make us tremble, and pray that thus we may not ſin. Examples of this ſin are very frequent, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.18. Come let us deviſe. <hi>Amos</hi> is accuſed of Conſpiracy againſt the King, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.10. It is common for the ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> to lay nets and ſnares to entrap the Prophets of the Lord. How great a ſin this is, hear what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>He that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, despiſeth not man, but God &amp;c.</hi> Obſerve the words: this Argument is a Concluſion of the former Reaſons, enforcing them all (ſaith <hi>Zanchy</hi> on this place) as if he ſhould ſay, It is not I <hi>Paul</hi> that exhort you, but Chriſt, and Chriſt is not onely man but God: he that willeth Sanctification is God, he that is an avenger of Fornication, and Covetouſneſſe, is God, he that calleth unto this holineſſe is God: he therefore that deſpiſeth our admonition in this caſe, deſpiſeth not man but God. God the Father who created us in holineſſe, God the Son who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:168349:98"/>us unto holineſſe, and God the Holy Ghoſt who keepeth us in true holineſſe. But how doth the Apoſtle prove this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>He that despiſeth &amp;c?</hi> becauſe ſaith he, <hi>God hath ſent his holy Spirit among you.</hi> There are two Readings of theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, if we tranſlate with <hi>Marl:</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> [God hath given us his holy Spirit] then <hi>Pauls</hi> argument is thus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; he that deſpiſeth us, deſpiſeth not man but God, for we write not out of our own authority, but as inſpird by the bleſſed Spirit which is God. If according to the beſt Copies [God hath ſent his holy Spirit among you] then the Apoſtle thus argueth, God hath ſent his Spirit to this end, that you may diſcern ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification to be his will. His Spirit is our keeper, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Our Comforter, <hi>John</hi> 14. Our Teacher, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. and therefore quench not the Spirit, in endeavouring to quench the gifts of the Spirit. He that ſtoppeth his ears, and hardneth his heart in the Preachers Exhortation by the Lord Jeſus, little regardeth the will and word of God, deſpiſeth not man, but God. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him not at your perill, you deſpiſe God himſelf, and you ſhall not go Scot-free, on your ſouls be it that hear me this day, whoſe Table-talke is furniſhed with jeſts and invectives againſt Miniſters, and whoſe ſtudy is how to vex, afflict, and torment them. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was ever baniſhed in peace, but ſent for home in warre. We are paſſed over in the daies of pride as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creatures, but when the wrath of God falls on their naked conſcience, then the Miniſter is thought on; when your pulſe beats ſickly, and you lie on your groaning beds, then are they intreated for counſell and adviſe.</p>
                     <p>What a madneſſe is it to contemn thoſe living whom (if God own you in mercy) you will love dying. I am ſick, and like to die, is there no balm in <hi>Gilead?</hi> is there no Phyſitian there? tell ſome tydings from heaven, ſome comfortable things of <hi>Sion,</hi> I beſeech you: you are the Ambaſſadours of Chriſt, and bring the glad tydings of peace, and is there no comfort, no peace for me? thus they, that in fair weather beat us, in foule run for ſhelter to us. We ſhall be thought to be good Miniſters, untill unpleaſing things drop from us, and then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well good conceit, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpake merrily of the Heathen, Unleſſe God pleaſe man, he ſhall be God no longer. But alas!
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:168349:98"/>ſay ſome, what are you, and what is your calling? why doe ye lift up your ſelves, the Congregation is holy, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you are but men, it is true; yet men of God, called and deputed his Officers and Ambaſſadours, intruſted with high, and holy myſteries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let a man &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, you are weak men, its true, ſubject to the like paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with others: yet our word is powerful, and the proudeſt of you, if God intend you good, is turned by our Miniſtery; and if the word be not the ſavour of life, it is the ſavour of death. <hi>We have this treaſure,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, you die like men: its true, but our words live, and it is the immortal Word of God that lives, and abides for ever, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Being born anew &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, all you ſay is but talk, words are but winde. Well, if you call the preaching of Gods Word <hi>talking,</hi> for ought I know you may talk of mercy and have none; it is ſuch talking as will tend either to thy converſion, or confuſion; for, <hi>whom we looſe on earth, are looſed in heaven; and whom we binde on earth, are bound in heaven.</hi> Lay aſide therefore contempt and diſdain of thoſe whom God hath choſen to bring thee the glad tydings of ſalvation. The Idolaters, and Heathens (doubtleſſe) ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt the men of this generation. How were <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts eſteemed by <hi>Jezebel,</hi> the Prieſts of the Grave by <hi>Ahab,</hi> the Aegyptian Prieſts by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Maſſe-Prieſts by Papiſts, and the <hi>Mufti</hi> by the Turks? And yet the true Preachers of the Word, that hold forth the ſaving doctrine of ſalvation, are amongſt Chriſtians as ſpectacles unto the world, as laughing, and gazing-ſtocks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. I am afraid it will befall many as it did <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſought <hi>Samuel</hi> when he was dead, whoſe counſell he did not regard, whileſt he was alive. It is obſerved, that the contempt of the Miniſtery leadeth to the greateſt and fouleſt ſinnes: for it is not poſſible that any ſhould honour the Meſſage of God, and deſpiſe him that God hath choſen to bring it: and this very ſinne opens a gap to all wickedneſs, and uſhereth in monſtrous impieties. Sathans king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (as is obſerved) ſtandeth on four props eſpecially, all which I finde in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of S. <hi>John.</hi> 1. Railing, <hi>verſe</hi> 48, <hi>Say we not well that thou art a Samaritane, and haſt a Devil?</hi> The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:168349:99"/>in their wickedeſt actions the perſecuting of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, thought they did God ſervice, and in their fouleſt words railing againſt Chriſt the Son of God, they think they doe well, <hi>Say we not well?</hi> It is ſaid of the Lyndians, that they worſhipt <hi>Hercules</hi> the beſt, when they railed the faſteſt. So many in rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reviling, think it an ornament, a grace, a badge of zeal, and that there is nothing amiſſe, <hi>Say we not well?</hi> No, no, ſuch ſaying derogates from God, the honour of Chriſtianity, and moſt unbecoming the Goſpel of Chriſt: But who railed thus? No <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> no <hi>Shimei,</hi> no ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> but ſuch as called themſelves <hi>holy,</hi> verſe 33. <hi>We be</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and were never in bondage to any man.</hi> Oh the great deluſion of the Devil to blinde men, and women, ſo that they think they ſay well when they ſin fouleſt, in thoſe words of Chriſt (who condemns the Phariſees gloſſe who judged that murder which conſiſted onely in the actual depriving a man of his life) you ſhall finde three degrees of ſin, and three degrees of puniſhment, <hi>Mat</hi> 5.22. The degrees of ſinne are angry thoughts, ſcornfull geſtures, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious words; to the firſt is oppoſed Judgment, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a Councel, to the third Hell fire. It is the ſaying of S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> to ſtrip men of paſſion is to make them no men. <hi>Eſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem de homine tollere.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Be angry, and ſinne not, Epheſ.</hi> 4 26. He alloweth that which is natural, and condemneth that which is culpable, ſo <hi>Gerſon, Ira non eſt peccatum quoad eſſe naturae, ſed quoad eſſe moris.</hi> That our anger ſhould not prove faulty, Chriſt ſets down two Rules for our direction: 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter, <hi>with a brother.</hi> 2. The manner, <hi>unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is left out in many both old and new Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; but ſome Greek Copies (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> acknowledgeth, retain it) and the reverend Fathers recite it, <hi>Omnis qui iraſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur fratri ſuo temerè,</hi> Whoſoever is angry with his Brother un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly or raſhly, as <hi>Cain</hi> with <hi>Abel, Ahab</hi> with <hi>Naboth, Saul</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> ſhall be in danger, ſaith CHRIST, of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he alludes, as <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> upon the place, to the proceedings of the Jewes in their Civil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ourts, by whom a ſmall matter was heard, and decided, by the judgment of three men; that of greater importance determined in a Councel of three and twenty Judges; and the greateſt of all by the ſentence of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:168349:99"/>threeſcore and eleven. Now Chriſts intent is to ſhew, that as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, ſo before God there are different degrees of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, according to the different degrees of ſin, and maketh the malice of the heart aſwell murther as that of the hand. <hi>Whoſoever is angry with his Brother &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, he condemneth ſcornful geſturs, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his brother, Racha, ſhall be in danger of the Councel;</hi> ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive this word of the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in Engliſh as much as <hi>ragged,</hi> Others from the Syrian <hi>Racha</hi> which is a terme of diſgrace, <hi>Hierome</hi> from <hi>rec,</hi> ſignifying <hi>Idle head.</hi> S. <hi>Auguſt:</hi> and others make it an interjection or broken ſpeech of an angry minde bewraying a malitious heart. Others think that by it is ſignified ſomething betwixt cloſe, and open railing, as a fiery counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſuch as was in <hi>Cain:</hi> a jeering fleering look, ſuch as was in <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> bending of the browes, ſhaking of the head, gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the teeth, thruſting forth of the tongue, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt condemneth opprobrious words, railing, and reviling, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay, Thou fool, ſhall be &amp;c.</hi> Bitter words are like the pricking of ſwords, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.18. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> complains of men whoſe tongues are as ſpears, and their words as ſharp arrows ſet on by the fire of hell, ſaith S. <hi>James, Jam.</hi> 3.6. and ſo are liable to hell fire. The railer with his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous tongue not onely poyſons his neighbours name, his box of pretious ointment, but like a ſharp raſor cuts his throat, this is one prop (and that a main one) of Sathans kingdome,</p>
                     <p>A ſecond is hypocriſie; the Jewes, vile, and ſinfull, yet could boaſt of their Father <hi>Abraham, Joh.</hi> 8.53. This conceit <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> would have beaten down, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>Think not to ſay, &amp;c.</hi> The varniſh of their hypocriſie did delude them, ſo that they grew in love with themſelves, and undervalued all others. This is another great prop of Sathans kingdome.</p>
                     <p>A third is Sophiſtry, fraud, and cunning; Moſt men ſtrive how to ſupplant and overthrow one another, to undermine the walls of innocency; plain dealing is dead, and (which is to be lamented) it died without iſſue; Once <hi>Orbis ingemuit factum ſe videre Arianum,</hi> The world groaned ſeeing it ſelfe made an Arian: It may now groane, <hi>Factum ſe videns Machiavellum,</hi> Seeing it ſelfe made a <hi>Machiavell:</hi> this is that falſe key that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:168349:100"/>opens the doore of the wrath and vengeance of God, maketh the Church of God ſo thin of Saints, and the World ſo full of Diſſemblers.</p>
                     <p>A fourth prop is Cruelty, what the Fox cannot doe the Lyon muſt, when railing fails, and patience is a conquerour, then Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than works in his inſtrumens by violence, <hi>John</hi> 8.59. <hi>They took up ſtones to caſt at him.</hi> Theſe four are not the weapons of a Chriſtians warfare, the properties of a true diſciple, parts of Gods building, but the props of Sathans kingdome.</p>
                     <p>They fearfully ſinne againſt God that either deſpiſe the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of God, or his meſſage; Preachers, or preaching; his ſervants, or his ſervice: and yet a thouſand offend of mean ones, of great ones, even in this particular. Oh how contemptible, vile, and baſe are the Miniſters of God in the eyes of many! They may juſtly complain with the Prophet <hi>Zachary, that they are wondred at, Zach.</hi> 3.8. And with the Apoſtle, That <hi>they are made a spectacle unto the world, and Angels, and to men, and made as the filth and off-ſcouring of all things unto this day,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.9, 13. They are Chriſts ſervants in a ſpeciall manner, his Ambaſſadours, Stewards, workers together with him; ſuch as he parles with all, and makes his fellow-Commoners, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Sauls</hi> men, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Seemeth it unto you to be a light thing to be the Kings Son-in-law?</hi> So may I ſay, Seemeth it a ſmall matter to be ſervants in ordinary to the King of kings? <hi>Receive them in the Lord with all gladneſſe, and hold ſuch in reputation,</hi> Phil. 2.29. <hi>We beſeech you Brethren, to know them which labour, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.12, 13. <hi>God will revenge their wrongs, their perſecution ſhall light on the perſecutors pates. Thou ſhalt ſmite,</hi> ſaith one of the Children of the Prophets unto <hi>Jehu, the houſe of</hi> Ahab <hi>thy Maſter, that I may avenge the blood of my ſervants the Prophets, and the blood of all the ſervants of the Lord of the hand of</hi> Jeſabel, 2 Kings 9.7. Many great diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements attend the Miniſtery. We may ſpend our lungs, preach out our hearts, before we can pierce mens hearts, or be inſtrumental to convert their ſouls. If the Lord cloſe the heart, we cannot by all our ſtrength open it; if people conceive not the things of God, let them not blame the Miniſters dulneſſe, but their own hardneſſe; dig at the root and there ſee the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:168349:100"/>cauſe, for the Lord hath ſet open the doors of mercy, Goſpel, grace, and glory, onely mens hearts are ſhut up, and untill the Lord unlock them, we may aſwell preach to theſe walls, and move the ſtones, as their cauterized and benumm'd conſciences. Now as ſtubbornneſſe attends their Miniſtery, ſo perſecution their perſons, for they are ſent forth as Lambs in the midſt of Wolves: not as Wolves amongſt Wolves, or Shepherds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Wolves, or Sheep about Wolves, but as harmleſſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lambs <gap reason="foreign">

The Dog hath teeth to bite, the Bear nayles to teare, the Bull his horns to daſh, the Boare his tuſh, the Lyon his paws and jaws to devoure. To theſe Chriſt compares the Enemies of his Church. 3. Nor his Miniſters, they are not free from perſecution; they muſt approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in much patience in afflictions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4. This the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle adviſeth <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. Watch thou in all things, ſuffer afflictions, this is to doe that work of an Evangeliſt, as a good ſouldier of Chriſt; to ſuffer afflictions, ready to bear bloody blows of open Enemies, and ſcorns of falſe Friends. To preach the Goſpel, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> as we ſhould, is to ſtirre up all the Furyes of Hell againſt us: It belongs to us <hi>Ex officio</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, to rebuke, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. to pluck up, to throw down, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. and we can expect therefore no great favour, for we encounter with Beaſts in the ſhape of Men, with Wolves in the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:168349:101"/>coats of Sheep, with Devils in the habit of Angels, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and wicked men, and muſt therefore expect perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but alas poor ſoules! they doe not ſo much wrong us as themſelves, they foam out their own ſhame, and bewray their wretched, I had almoſt ſaid, reprobate malice; ſuch as ſit down in the ſeat of the ſcornfull, make a low ſtep to damnation, God will laugh thoſe to ſcorn that laugh his to ſcorn, and deſpiſe thoſe that deſpiſe us, <hi>in expuentis recidit faciem, quod in Coelum expuit,</hi> That which a man ſpits againſt Heaven, ſhall fall back on his own face. Thoſe indignities done to the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhall not ſleep in the duſt, but ſtand up in judgment. Never was any truth ſo happily innocent, as to maintain it ſelfe free from calumny and abuſe. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was a faithfull, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Preacher, yet was ſlanderouſly reported, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. The beſt truths are ſubject to miſinterpretation, and there is not any doctrine ſo firmly grounded, and warily delivered whereupon calumny will not faſten, and ſtick ſlanderous imputations. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iohns</hi> mourning, nor <hi>Chriſts</hi> piping can paſſe the pikes, but the one hath a Devil, and the other is a Drunkard, and a Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibber; <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt</hi> came neither eating, nor drinking, and yet the people ſaid he had a Devil, and Chriſt came both eating and drinking, &amp;c. The Servant is not greater than his Maſter, neither an Ambaſſadour greater than he that ſent him; if they have called the Maſter of the houſe <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> how much more them of the houſhold? <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.25. If Chriſts doctrine did not? think we the doctrine of his Miniſters, and Servants can eſcape the ſtroak of mens tongues? Chriſt came to fulfill the Law, and yet he was accuſed to be a deſtroyer of the Law; he decides the queſtion for Caeſar, <hi>Give unto Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar &amp;c.</hi> and yet they charge him as if he ſpake againſt Caeſar, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.12. The book of the <hi>Acts</hi> doth witneſſe how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were ſlandered as Seducers, Sectaries, vain-Bablers, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Broachers of new, falſe, and peſtilent Doctrines. Nor did the Devil here leave off, for if we read the Apologies of <hi>Athenagoras, Tertullian,</hi> and others, it will amaze us to ſee what blaſphemous ſeditions, horrible and odious impieties were fathered upon the antient Chriſtian Doctors; thoſe perillous times inſtant in the daies of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> are become extant in our
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:168349:101"/>Age, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. Some turn to the doctrine of Devils, Others ſtart aſide to Schiſme, few love Religion in ſincerity, and the high, and honourable calling of the Miniſtery is vile, baſe, and contemptible. Now what are the Reaſons or grounds of this contempt, and deſpiſing of the Miniſters of the Goſpel? 1. They diſcover the filthineſſe, and unmask the hypocriſie of the ſons of men, and ſo raiſe all the furies of hell againſt them: It is obſerved the worſt men of a Pariſh regard a good Paſtor and his Doctrine the leaſt, for they are like Legs and Arms out of joynt, and ſo cannot endure the touch of the Chirurgeons hand, whoſe chiefeſt care is to work their cure: they are to reprove and rebuke, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. to root up, and throw down, <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.10. Men will raile, and rage, proſecute, and perſecute thoſe that would pull down and overthrow their pleaſant, delightfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and profitable ſinnes. The reaſon of this contempt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from that curſed nature of man, who is an enemy againſt all good, and <hi>Iſhmael</hi>-like perſecutes the truth, and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of it. <hi>Come let us imagine ſome deviſes, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 18. verſe 18. It is deſperate wickedneſſe to contend with thoſe that juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove you, to expoſtulate with them, caſt reproaches in their teeth, and lay to their charge, what you your ſelves are moſt guilty of. Thus dealt <hi>Corah</hi> and his Complices, with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Numb.</hi> 16 <hi>Ahab</hi> with <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. The Iſraelites with <hi>Ieremiah, Ier.</hi> 18. <hi>Amaziah</hi> with <hi>Amos, Am.</hi> 7. And the Scribes and Phariſees with our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.24. What a prepoſterous thing is it, that the Hand or Foot ſhould guide the Eye? The Childe rebuke the Father, the Patient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Phyſician, the Scholler check his School-Maſter, and the Sheep quarrell with the Shepherd? no leſſe prepoſterous is it for a people to inſtruct their Inſtructor, and leſſon thoſe that ſhould leſſon them. This contempt proceeds from a curſed heart, and is a ſigne of deſperate wickedneſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to bring all to a triplicity. This contempt of the Miniſters of the Goſpel may be imputed,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to Sathan, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that <hi>calumniator,</hi> who out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to the preaching would bring a loathing of truth; he is the Father of Lyes, the Prince of Darkneſs, and therefore hates Truth and Light, the Meſſage and the Meſſengers.</p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:168349:102"/>
                     <p>Secondly, it may be imputed to man, partly to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding when the judgment it ſelf is weak, or weakned through prejudice: Or elſe to the Will, men of corrupt mindes; or to the affections overcome by carnall, and ſeeming ſhews: Or to malitious wickedneſſe, and this is very dangerous, God will hardly forgive thoſe that ſin of malitious wickedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it may be imputed to God, not cauſing, but permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſuffering,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, out of juſtice, as a fearfull Judgment upon wicked ones, and to render them lyable to the greateſt and ſoreſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, out of triall of faithfull, painfull Teachers; not to be diſmaid though briars and thorns be againſt them, but to evidence their conſtancy and ſincerity, and how they live above all the ſcorn, and contempt of men, willing to ſuffer not the loſſe of reputation, but a thouſand deaths. I ſhould now come to ſeverall Uſes; but I will ſumme them up in two.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is by way of encouragement to ſuch as are perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is their Maſters, and the Churches Lot, a Condition from which they cannot plead exemption: If all that live godly muſt ſuffer perſecution, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. in vain doe the Preachers of Righteouſneſſe think to eſcape, and not drink of Chriſts cup. God hath made us a gazing-ſtock to men and Angels. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was nick-named <hi>Sathanaſius, Cyprian</hi> called <hi>Caprian, Paul</hi> accounted mad, and Chriſt himſelfe reputed a Conjurer. We muſt not fear, if Bryars and Thorns be againſt us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.6. but encourage our ſelves in the Lord our God, and conſider him that underwent the contradiction of ſinners.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond is of bearing patiently injuries, and they are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, Perſonal or Miniſterial; what concerneth his perſon, and what his calling. An indignity that onely toucheth our private perſon muſt be borne, as S. <hi>Auguſt:</hi> replied to railing <hi>Petilian, Poſſumus eſſe in his pariter copioſi, ſed nolimus eſſe pariter vani,</hi> He could be as full as he, but would not be ſo vain. The beſt Apologie to ſcorn, and petulancy, is patience, and ſilence; but when ſlanders redound to the diſcredit of their profeſſion, and calling, it behoves us not to be ſilent: When <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſcorned <hi>Paul</hi> as a mad man, he anſwered, <hi>I am not mad, oh noble
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:168349:102"/>Feſtus, but &amp;c.</hi> And the primitive Chriſtians often did Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize in defence of themſelves when truth was wounded through their ſides. It is obſerved by divers Divines that when as the Jewes objected againſt Chriſt, two crimes, one that <hi>he was a Samaritane,</hi> an irreligious vile perſon; and another, that <hi>he had a Devil:</hi> he neglects the firſt concerning his perſon, and ſtands upon that eſpecially which touched his doctrine; he anſwered, <hi>I have not a Devil, Ioh.</hi> 8.49. Chriſt accuſed of <hi>blasphemy</hi> did ever Apologize for himſelfe: zealous we ought to be for God, howſoever remiſſe in what concerneth our ſelves. It was the ſaying of a Father, He would rather loſe his life, than ſuffer one ſyllable of Gods holy truth to be betrayed. <hi>Meam injuriam patienter tuli, injuriam contra sponſam Chriſti ferre non potui,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hierome.</hi> Our own injuries we muſt bury in forgetfulneſſe; but wrongs to the truth of God, and Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt not put up. And further he ſaith, <hi>in crimine haereſeos ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem oportet eſſe patìentem,</hi> When any is accuſed of hereſie or ſchiſme, he ought by no means to put it up in ſilence, but make his lawfull defence. <hi>Hier: ad Pamma.</hi> I might here fall to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deplore the ſtate and condition of this Age, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarcely any Religion but what is tainted with a ſpice of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor any encouragement to Miniſters of the Goſpel, unleſs ſchiſmaticall Novelliſts the bane of Church and State.</p>
